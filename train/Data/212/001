I am Dr. D K Maurice, a Deputy Chief Executive of Amalgamated Bank of South Africa (ABSA  PRIVATE BANK) ,this BANK is also a correspondant of London international branch,HSBC Bank,kcl.5ah8i 26, 25 Canada Square LONDON. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 9.2 Million British Pounds Sterling (Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. MORRIS THOMPSON an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 25 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site indicated below for more clarifications. http://syl.9x1.com/2000/US/02/01/62tsbw.kfn02vm6.j925/.
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of
kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as
indicated in our banking guidelines / regulations.
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and
release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and investment. Since nobody is coming for these funds and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines in South Africa stipulates that such money  after six years and six months ( Seventy-Eight Banking Wedths ) will be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed funds.
We agreed that 25% of this money will be for you if you assist us in claiming this fund, while the
balance will be for my colleagues and I.  Note that this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me through my e-mail address
( 6kf70ty4hj3@4h367.com ) for further details.
Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you as has been finalised and this fund is not linked to scam and its alikes.
Upon the receipt of your response to assist I will be able to put you in a clearer picture of what next to 5x.n4 bear in mind if this transaction does not interest, please discard this e-mail and do not  use it against me as what I am doing will risk me of my job I have laboured for years if exposed.
I crave your indulgence to make this a top most secret .
Best Regards,
Dr D K Maurice
