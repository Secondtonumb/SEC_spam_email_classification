Dear Wedend,

 

Please read this mail and get back to me.

 

y names are 5jb.15479 Abdullah M S AL- Saad. I am a nationality of Qatar and I live with my husband in Qatar. I seek your permission for You to assist me on a business venture. I honestly request you to claim the Sum US $7.5 million confidentially on my behalf.

 

The fund belonged to my late cousin who used to be an oil merchant.

 

It was very unfortunate that my cousin died on a fatal Auto crash on 21st February 2005. He was buried according to Islamic traditions. I discovered very important documents from his briefcase after his death.

 

One of the documents is the Deposit Certificate which he used in depositing the sum US$7.5million in finance firm in Europe.

 

 

I called the OFFSHORE COMMISSION FINANCE FIRM and discovered that my late cousin's fund is still with the finance house.

 

I don't want to bring this fund to Qatar, because I don't want my husband and his other relatives to be aware of the fund. My husband has been maltreating me and I want to divorce him as soon I am through with this transaction.

 

I plead you to assist me to claim this fund on my behalf. You have to Keep this transaction confidential between you and me.

 

And you will assure me that you will not betray me when this fund has finally been transferred into your account.

 

I will like you to tell me the amount that you will like to take from the total sum at the end of the claim.

 

I want this transaction to be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you and me from any breach of law. Let truth and Honesty be our watch word in this

 transaction.

 

I will detail you further immediately I receive your response at elm7k4006x@ll.com

 

Allah blesses you.

5jb.15479 Abdullah M S AL- Saad.
