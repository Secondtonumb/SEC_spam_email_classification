ail from Mr. Barnett Esq.

Associates Limited
Phone::2348029770613

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to 
you based on a request by an investor and his need for 
investment/funds 
transfer.

y name is Johnson Barnett Esq. a 
Financial 
Consultant/Attorney based in Nigeria.

y company most times 
represents 
the interests of very wealthy Investors/Individuals due to 
the 
sensitivity of the position they hold in the society and the 
unstable 
investment environment of our country, they evacuate majority 
of their 
funds into more stable economies and developed nations where 
they can 
get good yield for their money.

I was recently approached by 
a 
Reserved Client of mine, whom I had personally worked with a few 
years 
ago when he was a Finance Minister and wants me to source for a 
reliable and trustworthy individual such as yourself, who will be 
willing to receive money on his behalf 
abroad, and at the same time 
advise on what form of investment that will be embarked with the funds 
when perfectly received.

The client has offered these terms:

1. 25% 
commission paid to you upon receipt of the funds through the original 
sum to be transferred. The funds in question are $45.3Million US 
Dollars.

2. Your details will be used to have the funds evacuated and 
you will standas the principle owner of the funds and will deal 
directly with the Remittance Bank without the involvement of the 
Investor.

If these terms are agreeable to you, kindly let me know and 
I will provide you with all necessary information and procedures 
involved.

Sincerely yours,

Johnson Barnett ESQ (President)
J.K. 
Barnett & Associates Limited.

PS* The 
client is willing to make 
available the fund to your possession and in your country within 25 
days 
of confirmation of your capabilities.
