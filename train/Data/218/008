Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the 0pp0rtunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

We hung them out to dry.  Spring forward fall back. Too little too late.   She's the apple of my eye.   Tall as a tree.   Watered down. Sturdy as an oak.   Shake like a leaf. Up one side and down the other.   Your name is mud.  Red as a beet.  Sly as a fox.   She has a green thumb.

She's the apple of my eye.   Put to bed with a shovel. Slow as a snail.   A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Still water runs dirty and deep.   Stuck in a rut.  Your ass is grass. Walking on water. So hungry I could eat a horse. When the cows come home.  Water doesn't run uphill.   This is for the birds.   You say potayto, I say potahto. Useless as tits on bull.   Want my place in the sun.
