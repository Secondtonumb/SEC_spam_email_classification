      Zeal without knowledge, is fire without light Great minds think alike Shame face ah feel like cent ice. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
      He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. A fly will not get into a closed mouth. But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
    
     
      A sprat to catch a mackerel. Books and friends should be few and goodIf there were no lossers there could be no winners  He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son 
      Yuh can't fatten cow fuh another man butcher.	 Better late than.. pregnant. He who hesitates is lost Life is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved 
    
  
  Practice makes perfect and Nobody's perfect. It is never too late to be what you might have been But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. Love thy neighbour as thy self True blue will never stain Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow  My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. Time is a great healer Do not praise yourself while going into battle; praise yourself coming out of battle
