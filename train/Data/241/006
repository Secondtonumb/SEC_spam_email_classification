By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead! spat Voldemort. He
sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the
security guards desk, which burst into flame.
Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated
from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt
his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to
conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The
spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a
deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound.
You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore? called Voldemort, his scarlet
eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. Above such brutality, are you?Hi,
