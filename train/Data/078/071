Dear Wedend.
 
I am Ibrahim Hassan, Project Accountant of the Contract Award Committee 
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC).
 
In Apirl/20/2003 my cooperation was awarded some contracts for 
refurbishing of the petro-chemical complex at Eleme,supply and installation of 
rigging and drilling eqiupment and repairing of Warri and Port-Harcourt 
Refineries for $420,000,000.00 but with my privileged position , the 
contract value was over-invoiced to $434,000,000.000, this benefits me 
and my department ($14Million) ,000,000 as over invoiced.
 
On August/16/2004 ,the foregign contractor that we awarded the contract 
received their full payments from the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN). 
 
In this view,we require an honest and trustworthy person who will not 
betray our trust to use his / her company and account to transfer out 
the balance of the over in-voiced before we could share it, because if we 
use our local account for the tranfer, (CBN) will suspect us.
 
That is why we want to bestow this trust on you and it is our sincere 
wish that you do not betray us .So it is because of the balance of 
($14Million) which we now have left that we are sending you this 
confidential e-mail ,we have favoured an incentive of 10% to you as the account 
owner and 5% to offset all expenses that might be incured on the process 
of the tranfer, while the remaining 85% will for me and my department.
 
Confirm to me your trustworthiness and acceptance of this proposal, 
Please your urgent response is greatly required and should you not be in a 
position to assist,kindly inform me as quickly as possible so that i 
could make an alternative arrangement.
 
Best Regards.
Please Contact.
Dr Ibrahim Hassan.
