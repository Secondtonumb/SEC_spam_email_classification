icroscale Heat Transfer Course
Lausanne, Switzerland, June 12-16

Dear Colleague:

I wish to announce the presentation of a new heat transfer course directed towards R&D engineers and university Ph.D. students and post-doctorants on Microscale Heat Transfer. The course will be of interest to all those currently working on microscale heat transfer technology and research, covering single-phase flows and heat transfer, two-phase flows, boiling, condensation, pressure drops, prediction methods, numerical methods for single-phase and two-phase flows in microchannels, air-side heat transfer on compact coils, applications, etc. Ample time is allowed for discussion and interaction with the lecturers (including 25 lunches and a reception/lab tour). The course lecturers will be Prof. J.R. Thome, Prof. I. Zun, Dr. G.P. Celata and Prof. A.M. Jacobi. The course is hosted by Heat Transfer Research Inc., an international research consortium with over 600 industrial partners.

The course will be held in Lausanne at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology from June 12-16, 2006.

Any information on the course descritpion, with hotel booking details, registration form and payment forms (credit card and bank transfer) is posted in internet at:
