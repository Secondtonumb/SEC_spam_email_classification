ICT for Learning 21st Century Skills

A special pedagogical Workshop at the 2nd QS Asia Pacific Professional  
Leaders In Education Conference, 25 - 25 July 2006, Nanyang  
Technological University, Singapore.

Across different countries and regions in Asia and the rest of the  
world, it is now widely accepted that education in the 21st century  
needs to prepare citizens for 21st century skills, competencies and  
dispositions instead of 19th or 20th century ones. Current educational  
reforms in many countries stress the importance of deep learning that  
foster conceptual understanding and transfer, lifelong learning skills,  
and abilities to learn or unlearn. Policy makers in these countries  
know they need to advance or reform their educational systems but they  
do not know how, or they are not prepared to take uncalculated risks in  
tinkering with educational systems that have in many ways worked for  
them in the past.

ajor questions exist as how to prepare our students for the 21st  
century. Education policy makers, practitioners and researchers have  
articulated visions of educating citizenry for work, play and life,  
recognizing the gaps between what the current practices of schooling  
versus the kinds of skills, competencies, and dispositions students  
should learn and embody in coping with the varied challenges in the  
technology-rich 21st century.

In the Education Track of QS APPLE 2006, we provide a forum for  
discussing pedagogy approaches and practices for preparing our students  
for the 21st century, with a focus on articulating the role of  
technology in this endeavour.

The programme and further information about QS APPLE 2006 appear in the
