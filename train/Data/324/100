Dear Hailin,

No matter where you are in your organization, you want to have an impact on
what’s going on ?we all do. Here’s your chance to learn how you can
influence those above, below, and equal with you from the leadership expert ?John Maxwell! And you can ask him those nagging questions by phone or email
during the conference. Register today at
http://9k33chbba.ghfo14d.com/0gd.zm?id=568.

In his nearly thirty years of teaching leadership, John Maxwell has encountered
this question again and again: How do I apply leadership principles if I’m not
the boss? Maxwell will answer this question in Soundview’s audio conference
“Developing Your Influence From Anywhere in the Organization.?
Please join us on April 20th. You can fill your conference room with people for
the low price of $169 ($199 for non-subscribers). There isn’t much time left,
so register now at http://9k33chbba.ghfo14d.com/0gd.zm?id=568.

Regards,
Rebecca Clement
