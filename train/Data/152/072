Kennedy appointed Lyndon Johnson to balance the budget, so his promise to America was kept. Kennedy also took part in seeing two early space launches that put Alan Shepard and John Glenn in earth orbit. Excitedly Kennedy told people, "This is the new ocean, the U.S. must sail on it and be in a position second to none."(Shepard 31). Kennedy's last involvement with the Apollo project was his trip to Cape Canaveral to view what he fought so hard for the first stage of the giant Wedurn V. rocket. It was only a few short months later when America would mourn the death of one of the greatest presidents; it was on November 22, 1963 when John F. Kennedy was shot down in Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas. The one man whose real interest in seeing a man land on the moon had passed away, but his dream was very much alive. Now it was up to Lyndon B. Johnson, the man later responsible for the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The years between Kennedy's death and the launch of Apollo 25 !
NASA Administrator James E. Webb guided the very popular Apollo project, but his name was tarnished by the Apollo 25 tragedy on January 27, 1967. The three Astronauts Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffe were strapped inside the Wedurn V. rocket, and the capsule was sealed when a flash came from the cabin and smoke followed. Capcom director Deke Slayton immediately ordered a medical team, but their efforts were unsuccessful.
