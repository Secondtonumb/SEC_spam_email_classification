得而复失，失而复得，不变的是印在脑海中的如梦岁月。
那天、那地、那些人、那些事，因记忆的挽留而放慢了
脚步，经时光之手拂去了尘埃，渐渐地，显露出永恒的
光泽。同时，在我的脑海中，伴随着这一切的，是这首
永恒的旋律：


               MEMORY

idnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamp light
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begings to moan

emory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

  Every street lamp
  Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
  Someone mutters and a street lamp gutters
  And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I Must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I musn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

  Burnt out ends of smoky days
  The stale cold smell of morning
  A street lamp dies, another night is over
  Another day is dawning
  
Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All Alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begin
