      United we stand, divided we fall  He that knows nothing, doubts nothing A penny always turns up. From the sweetest wine the tartest vinegar
      Give credit where credit is due When children stand still they have done some ill Flies never visit an egg that has no crack  A good beginning makes a good ending. A squirrel is just a rat with good PR. A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch.
    
     
      A cat may look at a king. He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others What we see depends mainly on what we look for Curiosity killed the cat.
      Silence is golden. For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. A person who can smile when things go wrong has found someone to blame it on.  He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian All is for the best in the best of the possible worlds Know which side your bread is buttered  The higher the monkey climbs, the more he shows his tail 
    
  
  The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everythingWe had nothing to do and we did it very well  One cannot quarrel without an opponent  After a storm comes a calm. When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. Revenge is a dish best served cold. If cow-man pass wild meat whah mek me must pick up am. God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world  Love is blind Children Have Wide Ears and Long Tongues Never too old to learn
