      April is the cruellest month When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead. A friend in need is a friend indeed. The older the fiddler, the sweeter the tune.
      Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh. Not to know is bad; not to wish to know is worse 
    
    
      It takes one to know oneAll cassava get same skin but all nah taste same way.
      Age has no friend but the wrinkles of the mind The early worm enjoys a leisurely breakfast  Too many clicks spoil the browse. The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait Civility costs nothing 
    
  
  Love laughs at the locksmiths A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds.Let bygones be bygones A change is as good as a rest. Speak when you are spoken to When the wine is in, the wit is out  So long as you do your best in life, whatever happens will be for the best While there is life there is hope There but for the grace of God go I  Never go to bed on an argument
