         SHANGHAI ANRUI ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.
¡¡
¡¡
Shanghai AnRui Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. is a high technical enterprise which manufacture the energy-saving electronic ballast for Metal Halide lamp or High Pressure Sodium lamp. Our products widely used in different areas, such as Street, Highway, Rail station and yard, Bus stations, Bridge, Tunnel, Airport, Harbor, Parking, Sport arena etc. 
 
Excellent Performance AR/EB
  l       Green Lighting, Energy-saving 
       l     Power Factor >0.99£» 
                                l     Reducing current 50% than MB£» 
     l    Energy saving reached 20-50%.
        l   Low harmonic distortion, stable power control 
Total harmonic distortion <10%£¬reduce pollution of electric web. AR/EB has a built-in internal adaptive control system. It can guarantee AR/EB work normally when electric web¡¯s voltage fluctuate to a great extent (90V~270V), at the same time maintained constant output power by an integrator circuit and prevent lamp cathode being impacted from rush current. 
¡¡
l    Full-functional Protection 
There are automatic full-functional protection circuit of pulse soft star and modulating frequency in AR/EB. When meet open current or short current, self-protection circuit is active, which will stop the source-power circuit and automatic shut down the output power of electronic ballast. Only after the failure situation has been resolved, the normal work condition can recalled and a safe environment for ballast and lamp is settle again. 
l       Modulating frequency, No acoustic resonance 
There are cutting acoustic resonance circuit in AE/EB. We used a method of high frequency modulation technology for operating the lamp. The EB¡¯s working frequency changes at 25~100kHz endlessly. Therefore, arcing of lamp will not work at a certain acoustic resonance  frequency. The flicker will never be seen. It can reduce the pollution of lighting and protect our eyes. 
  
l       Increasing output lumens and color render index 
  
l       Long-life Promise 
Life is about 15,000 hours. 
  
l       Various model 
1.   Series of AR/EB for different countries and regions electric web and voltage, rated voltage as follow:
110V/208V/220V/240V/277V£¬Power frequency£º50/60Hz£» 
2.   Type:
H£º35w/50w/70w/100w/150w/175w/250w/320w/360w/400w/1000w£»
HPS£º70w/100w/150w/250w/320w/400w/600w/1000w£» 
3.   Among series of AR/EB, there are some particular products, such as the particular spectrum 10K, 20K 250W EB, specially designed to suit for warm shed and particular environments.
4.   The dual functions of 100W/150W/250W/400W/600W/1000W EB can drive HPS or MH lamp of the same wattage and needn¡¯t change ballast.
5.   The function of AC/DC interchangeable EB. When AC is cut and change to DC immediately, the lighting won¡¯t be broken. It is economical and convenient.
6.   Electronic ballast of Ceramic Halide and Crystal Lamp. 
7.   HID EB for long distance (100 meters). 



*We can also provide bulb.
