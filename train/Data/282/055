the
same incomprehensible sense of grief which had come to him  on  the balcony.
He at once sought for its explanation and its  cause was a strange one : the
Procurator was obscurely aware that he still  had something to  say  to  the
prisoner and that perhaps, too, he had more to learn from him.
     Pilate banished the thought and it passed as quickly as it had come. It
passed, yet that  grievous ache  remained a  mystery, for  it  could not  be
explained  by  another thought that had flashed  in and out of his mind like
lightning--' Immortality ... immortality  has come .  . .' Whose immortality
had come? The Procurator could not understand it, but  that puzzling thought
of immortality sent a chill over him despite the sun's heat.
     'Very well,' said Pilate. ' So be it.'
     With that  he looked round. The visible  world vanished from  his sight
and an astonishing change occurred. The  flower-laden rosebush  disappeared,
the cypresses fringing the upper terrace disappeared, as did the pomegranate
tree, the white  statue among  the foliage and the foliage  itself. In their
place came a kind of dense purple mass in which seaweed waved and swayed and

Pilate himself was swaying with  it. He was seized, suffocating and burning,
by the most terrible rage of all rage--the rage of impotence.
     'I am suffocating,' said Pilate. ' Suffocating! '
     With  a cold damp hand he tore the buckle from the collar  of his cloak
and it fell on to the sand.
     'It  is  stifling  today,  there  is  a thunderstorm  brewing,'  said
Caiaphas, his gaze fixed on the Procurator's  reddening face, foreseeing all
the discomfort that the weather was yet  to bring. '  The month of Nisan has
been terrible this year! '
     'No,' said Pilate. ' That  is not why I am suffocating. I feel stifled
by your  presence, Caiaphas.'  Narrowing his eyes Pilate  added  : ' Beware,
High Priest! '
     The  High Priest's dark eyes  flashed  and--no less cunningly  than the
Procurator--his face showed astonishment.
     'What do I hear, Procurator? ' Caiaphas answered proudly and calmly. '
Are you threatening me--when sentence has been duly pronounced and confirmed
by yourself? Can  this be  so?  We  are accustomed  to the  Roman Procurator
choosing his words carefully before saying anything. I trust no one can have
