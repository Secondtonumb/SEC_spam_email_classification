The professor  changed his mind and instead of ringing up Burye dialled
the number of the Leech Bureau  and asked  them to send a leech to his house
at  once. Replacing the receiver on the rest, the  professor turned  back to
his desk  and let out a  wail. On  the far side of the  desk sat  a woman in
nurse's uniform with a bag  marked ' Leeches '. The sight  of her mouth made
the professor groan  again--it was a wide, crooked, man's mouth with  a fang
sticking out of it. The nurse's eyes seemed completely dead.
     'I'll take the money,' said the nurse, ' it's no good to you now.' She
grasped the labels with a bird-like claw and began to melt into the air.
     Two hours passed. Professor Kuzmin  was sitting up in bed  with leeches
dangling  from  his  temples,  his  ears and  his neck.  At his  feet on the
buttoned quilt  sat  the grey-haired Professor Burye, gazing sympathetically
at Kuzmin  and  comforting him  by  assuring him  that it was all  nonsense.
Outside it was night.
     We do not know what other marvels happened in Moscow that night and  we
shall not, of course, try to find out--especially as the time is approaching
to move into the second half of this true story. Follow me, reader!

At the sunset  hour of one warm spring day two  men were  to be seen at
Patriarch's Ponds. The first of them--aged about forty, dressed in a greyish
summer  suit--was  short,  dark-haired,  well-fed  and bald.  He carried his
decorous pork-pie hat by the brim and his neatly shaven face was embellished
by  black hornrimmed spectacles of  preternatural  dimensions. The other,  a
broad-shouldered young  man with  curly reddish hair  and a check cap pushed
back  to the nape of  his neck,  was  wearing a tartan  shirt,  chewed white
trousers and black sneakers.
     The first was none other than Mikhail Alexandrovich  Berlioz, editor of
a  highbrow literary magazine  and chairman of the management cofnmittee  of
one of the  biggest Moscow  literary  clubs, known by  its  abbreviation  as
massolit; his  young companion  was  the  poet Ivan  Nikolayich Poniryov who
wrote under the pseudonym of Bezdomny.
     Reaching  the shade  of the budding lime  trees,  the two writers  went
straight to a gaily-painted kiosk labelled'Beer and Minerals'.
     There was an oddness about  that  terrible day in  Oct  which  is worth
recording  : not  only at  the  kiosk but along the whole avenue parallel to
