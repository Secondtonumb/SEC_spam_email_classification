Daddies know best Wise men think alike. 

  A friend in need is a friend indeed. If dutty ah deh ah roof tap, yuh barrel ah catch am. A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men. Home sweet home Distance makes the heart grow fonder A chain is no stronger than its weakest link. Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wiseClothes make a man You get out of life what you put into it 
  A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spirit Never be afraid to sit awhile and think  Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company  The pot calls the kettle black. A cat has nine lives. No pain, no gain Whah hurt eye does mek nose run water. Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. In Gates we trust. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me. Contributed by Charon Muck, 25 Oct 2000  
  A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor. Every picture tells a story Seven years nah too much fuh wash speck off ah bird neck. We had nothing to do and we did it very well Teaching of others teacheth the teacher You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb If the Blind Lead the Blind, Both Shall Fall Into the Ditch Fine feathers make fine birds 
  Fools seldom differ.Cleanliness is next to Godliness When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way. Is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness Clothes make a man All good things must come to an end A new broom sweeps clean.Do not search for a calf under an ox  Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity  
  To have is to hold and to hold is to have Like flogging a dead horse A creaking door hangs longest. Who feels guilty, feels responsible Flies Come to Feasts Unasked When fortune smiles, embrace her After dinner rest a while, after supper walk a mile Some are Wise and Some are Otherwise Strangers are just friends you have not met yet 
  When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern  He who awaits much receives little Love nature , live lightly What you see in yourself is what you see in the worldWhen yuh deh in bad luck wet paper self ah cut yuh. Oh, what a tangled Web site we weave when first we practice. Once bitten twice shy  Christmas comes but once a year 
  March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb To have is to hold and to hold is to haveTime and tide wait for no man. Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both Keep your friends close but your enemies closer You have to understand, somethings you will never understand  Two heads are better than one Better to be envied than pitied The more one knows, the less one believes 
  Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
