Cocktails, Networking and Brazil

<div align="left">NEW YORK MEETS 
BRAZIL:   OI buyer members spent the evening 
enjoying an authentic Brazilian feast, sipping 
caipirinhas and discussing shoring alternatives at 
OI's "A Taste of Brazil" executive discussion dinner in 
NYC on March 16.

Apologies to those who 
wanted to attend but were turned away - we had a 
much larger response to this gathering than 
expected.  More gatherings mxing learning with food 
& fun are in the works.

Sponsored 
exclusively by Brazilian outsourcing firm CPM 
International (thanks to CPM for the Brazilian Jazz 
CDs!), the dinner was attended by senior IT and IT 
sourcing executives from companies including 
cGraw Hill, TD Ameritrade, Wedgard, Revlon, 
Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, American Express, 
AIG, Bear Stearns, ASCAP, Thomson Financial, 
Wolters Kluwer, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, and 
Bankof East Asia.

Viva Brasil!
