Who feels guilty, feels responsible Beauty is in the eye of the beholder 

  A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. The King can make a knight, but not a gentleman  One mans loss is another mans gain An ant may well destroy a whole dam  Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. Experience is the best teacher Love is blind.We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain  
  Goodness is better than beauty Wherever you may be let your wind go free Half a loaf is better than no bread  A wise son brings joy to his father,but a foolish son grief to his mother. Cut your coat according to your cloth Admiration is the daughter of ignorance In for a penny, in for a pound Middle age is when broadness of the mind and narrowness of the waist change places  Lightning never strikes twice in the same place The Absent are Always Wrong Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain and most fools do 
  They that walk much in the sun will be tanned at last One volunteer is worth ten pressed men Abundance, like want, ruins many. Silence is golden.Like flogging a dead horse Nah tek yuh mattie eye fuh see. Distance makes the heart grow fonder Life is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved A tidy house holds a bored woman. 
  Better one house spoiled than twoIt takes one to know one Mouth cut trousers nah ah fit Massa. Fight fire with fire Excess of ceremony shows want of breeding  A good beginning makes a good ending. Life is one long catwalk No man is a hero to his valetNever speak ill of the dead  
  Make hay while the sun shines Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves  The early bird catches the worm. You can only go as far as you push When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. Some are Wise and Some are Otherwise A Small Spark Makes a Great Fire.Quickly come, quickly go A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. Fair without , false within 
  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  Revenge is a dish best served cold If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick  Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked man ruling over a helpless people Different strokes for different folk The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar People living in glass houses should not pelt stones. When two buffalo fight, it is the grass that gets hurt! Home is where you hang your @. 
  Better to be envied than pitied Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his follyA quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day. There is more than one way to skin a cat Good and quickly seldom meet  The first step is the hardest It is nice to be important but it is more important to be nice Zeal without knowledge, is fire without light Lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Time and tide wait for no man He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others 
  Poor men seek meat for their stomach; rich men stomach for their meat
