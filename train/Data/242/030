Dear  Expert

On behalf of a large Danish company, I am trying to find an expert with
knowledge about Biopolymers produced by microbial expression and
fermentation. Please find the project description below.

How to proceed?  
If you like to give some input to this request, just send me a short
mail with a description of your idea for a solution. We will get in
touch with you immediately to discuss the details. 

If you need further information on the project, want to discuss any
topic or refer us to someone else do not hesitate to contact us. 

Deadline for your response is: 20.07.2006

I would like to thank you in advance for your assistance. 

Best regards
Henrik Tarp

Biopolymers produced by microbial expression and fermentation

A large Biotechnology Company with state-of-the art expertise in
microbiology, biotechnology and gene technology, wants to establish
contact with experts, knowledge institutions, universities or others
with knowledge and technologies for recombinant production of
biopolymers.

The company has specific interest in identifying technologies for
recombinant production of the following polysaccharides.

"	beta-glucan
"	galactomannan
"	pullulan
"	scleroglucan

The company is familiar with the below mentioned technologies, but are
looking for new alternative technologies.

"	? -glucans extracted from yeast
"	Scleroglucan obtained by fermentation of Sclerotium rofsii
"	Pullulan obtained by fermentation of Aureobasidium pullulans
"	Galactomannan is extracted from plants (seeds) and
microorganisms

The focus / specifications:

"	Produced by microbial expression and fermentation.
"	Production of high purity and quality products
"	The products could either be polysaccharides or proteins
"	It should be patentable
"	Biopolymer application level:
o	Technical applications
o	Medical device applications
o	Pharmaceutical applications


The company is interested in identifying and contact to experts, with
knowledge about technologies for recombinant production of the above
mentioned polysaccharides, which matches the focus mentioned in the
description.

If you are familiar with technologies or research, which could be part
of a solution, for one or more of the above described areas, we would
like you to contact us. 

The company is interested in ideas, technologies or research, which has
made proof of concept, and not necessarily a ready-made solution.

Technology Partnership, has further information about this project, and
is available for questions, comments and to discuss ideas and solutions
to this project.
