IT2IT Insight		                  March 2006
============================================================
       The program for IT professionals, by IT professionals


This month, BEA Deputy CIO Dale Slaughenhaupt discusses the 
benefits a reference architecture can bring to your 
organization and its stakeholders. IT2IT Insight also takes 
a look at how empowering business peers to take on application 
development benefits everyone-both inside and outside your 
company. And we examine how an enterprise service bus makes 
it easier to integrate and deploy new services. 

As always, we welcome feedback on the issues and technologies 
we address. With your help we will constantly refine IT2IT 
Insight to serve your changing needs.
