                    December 8 - 10, 2006 - Barcelona, Spain 
                             (http://www.iadis.org/celda2006)

             Endorsed by: IEEE Technical Committee on Learning Technology
             and Japanese Society of Information and Systems in Education

* Keynote Speaker (confirmed):
Professor David Merrill, Brigham Young University Hawaii, USA

* Invited Talk (confirmed):
Dr Marco Marsella, European Commission, DG Information Society, Directorate E, Unit E3 TeL

* Tutorial Expert (confirmed):
Professor J. Michael Spector, Florida State University, USA

* Conference background and goals 
The IADIS CELDA 2006 conference aims to address the main issues concerning with the 
evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in digital age. 
There have been huge advancements in both cognitive psychology and computing that 
have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines has never 
been faster before and this marriage has affected the very basis of the academia. 
Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivist approaches, student-cantered 
learning and collaborative approaches have emerged, and are being supported by 
technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agents systems 
to name a few. This merger has created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. 
This conference aims to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to 
these developments. Main tracks have been identified (see below). However innovative 
contributions that do not fit into these areas will also be considered as long as they are directly related to the overall theme of the conference. 

* Format of the Conference 
The conference will comprise of invited talks, oral presentations for discussion-oriented 
papers, and poster sessions for work-in-progress. The proceedings of the conference will 
be published in the form of a book and CD-ROM. 

Authors of the best published papers in the CELDA 2006 proceedings will be invited to 
publish extended versions of their papers in Journal of Research on Technology in Education. 

* Types of submissions 
Full papers, Short Papers, Reflection papers and Tutorials. All submissions will go through a double-
blind refereeing process with at least two international experts. 

* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following areas: 
- Acquisition of expertise
- Assessing progress of learning in complex domains 
- Assessment of exploratory learning approaches 
- Assessment of exploratory technologies 
- Cognition in education 
- Collaborative learning
