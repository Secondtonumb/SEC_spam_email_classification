      It is in vain to cast your net where there is no fish  A Growing Youth Has a Wolf in His Belly.
      It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive Forewarned is forearmed After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box Sleep is better than medicine
    
    
      We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain  Shame face ah feel like cent ice.Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors
      No wind, no waves Don't put all your hypes in one home page. To have is to hold and to hold is to have A bad penny always turns up. When two buffalo fight, it is the grass that gets hurt! 
    
  
  A journey of a thousand sites begins with a single click. When I turned myself over to God, i took my life out the hands of an idiot True love never grows oldIt takes one to know one Half a loaf is better than no bread  He Who Keeps Company with the Wolf Will Learn How to Howl To whom God gives, to him also the people give  We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. Love sees no faults. Hard work never did anyone any harm  Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud He who pays the piper calls the tune  Tongue nah gat teeth but he ah bite fuh true. Man strength deh ah he hand, woman strength deh a she mouth. Past cure, past care
