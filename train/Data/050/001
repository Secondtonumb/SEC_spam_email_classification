      Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. Water that has been begged for does not quench the thirst A danger foreseen is half avoided. Pain is temporary, victory is forever 
      When two buffalo fight, it is the grass that gets hurt! A tidy house holds a bored woman. A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day.

      Keep your mouth shut and your ears open. The bigger the better. A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  Home sweet home

Promises are like babies Easy to make, hard to deliver What does not kill you makes you stronger A nod is as good as a wink to a blind man. The best things come in small packages Everyday is a fresh slate
