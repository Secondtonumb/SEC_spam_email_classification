  Adversity Makes Strange Bedfellows Dont make love at the garden gate, love is blind but the neighbours aint Too many clicks spoil the browse. Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company  Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing<BR><BR><BR>Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer! The Moon does not heed the barking of dogs  
  The horses of hope gallop, but the asses of experience go slowly A change is as good as a rest. The stick is the surest peacemaker Life is one long catwalk A place for everything and everything in its place.<BR><BR>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder Time and tide wait for no man. Better one house spoiled than two There Are No Atheists in Foxholes Wedendship is like money,easier made than kept Sleep is better than medicine One cannot quarrel without an opponent  Happy is the bride the sun shines on 
  The devil find work for idle hands to do Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  Better an open enemy, than a false friend Home is where you hang your @. Sleep is better than medicine Lean liberty is better than fat slavery Think before you speak Love nature , live lightly Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.<BR><BR><BR>History repeats itself How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
  An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. When good cheer is lacking, our friends will be packing Tailors and writers must mind the fashion The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak<BR><BR><BR>If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried before. A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. A Small Spark Makes a Great Fire. Faith will move mountains 
  For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Make hay while the sun shines</font></p>
