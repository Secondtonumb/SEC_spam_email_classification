      A baby is an alimentary canal with a loud voice at one end and no responsibility at the other. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence Every path has its puddle.
      Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains. Nobody want dutty powder.
    
    
      Many a mickle makes a muckle All things are possible with godFrom the sweetest wine the tartest vinegar
      A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions. These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. Abundance, like want, ruins many. For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 
    
  
  There Are No Atheists in Foxholes Diligence is the mother of good fortuneA drowning man will clutch at straws. Do as you would be done by When yuh play out all yuh trump cards yuh gat to lose till game done. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder Pain is so close to pleasure Too many cooks spoil the broth
