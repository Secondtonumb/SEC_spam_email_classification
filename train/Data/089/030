Prevention is better than cure 

  Dont teach your grandmother to suck eggs Two fools in a house are too many We had nothing to do and we did it very well  Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit. A good conscience is the best divinity. Silence is golden Confidence is a plant of slow growthEasy come, easy go Love is blind. 
  Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice A friend in need is a friend indeed. Many people know how to say nothing; few know when Common fame is seldom to blame Christmas comes but once a year Divide and ruleIf oil ah float watah deh ah battam.	 Merry Nights Make Sorry Days Least said soonest mended A good name is better than a good face. 
  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife Never put your tongue on an iceberg When in doubt, do nothingFine feathers make fine birds You get out of life what you put into it In vino veritas  Better bend than break Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief  
  Better to be alone than in bad company  A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.Folly grows without watering Never judge by appearences Live to the point of tears Knowing is not enough; We must Apply Willing is not enough; We must Do The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. A friend in need is a friend indeed. He who makes no mistakes, makes nothingDivide and rule 
  Good things come in small packages. If in doubt, mumble Bitter pills may have blessed effects A happy heart is better than a full purse.  When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead. Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern A danger foreseen is half avoided. A soft answer turneth away wrath. After the storm comes the calm 
  A bad penny always turns up. To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow In the land of hope there is never any winter One years seeding means seven years weedingManners maketh man Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you A friend in need is a friend indeed. Great minds think alike, simple minds cant think of anything different Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget 
  It is good to be knowledgeable, but better to be lovable  Its a dogs life Let bygones be bygonesManners maketh man For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life. Every Cook Praises His Own Broth Once in a blue moon Still waters run deep Don't cross your bridges before you come to them. You only live once Birds of a feather flock together The early bird catches the worm A new broom sweeps clean. 
  A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall.
