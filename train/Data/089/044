      Elementary sartorial techniques initially applied obviate the need for repetitive similar actions to the square of three. He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another dayPatience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit  Beware of Greeks bearing gifts

  A miss is as good as a mile.The rotten apple injures its neighbours If the wind will not serve, take to the oars When you live in the past, it costs you the present  The early worm enjoys a leisurely breakfast  Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh.
