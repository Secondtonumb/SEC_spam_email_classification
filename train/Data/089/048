  Quality is better than quantity  Old habits die hard Blood is thicker than water Do as I say, and not as I do Every bush a man night time. They that dance must pay the fiddler The pen is mightier than the sword. Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are GoneNo matter how long a log stays in the water it does not become a crocodile  The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  
  Count your blessings As busy as a bee A slap on the back is only a few inches away from a kick in the butt. All good things come to he who waits  Doubt is the beginning not the end of wisdom A friend in need is a friend indeed.Do right and fear no man  The pot calls the kettle black. Keep your powder dry  Love is blind. 
  There is a time and a place for everything A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept. The bigger they are, the harder they fall  Flies Come to Feasts Unasked There is more than one way to skin a cat Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled Man cannot live on bread alone A stitch in time saves nine. Whah hurt eye does mek nose run water. Knowing is not enough; We must Apply Willing is not enough; We must Do Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse. 
  Its only rock n roll but I like it A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.When you live in the past, it costs you the present  The cobra will bite you whether you call it cobra or Mr Cobra  A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight. The last drop makes the cup run over A little of what you fancy does you good.  Melt the icy fingers of fear with the sunshine of hope  Never judge by appearences A miss is as good as a mr.A man is known by the company he keeps. The geek shall inherit the earth. 
  Cat a ketch rat, but he a teef he massa fish. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway A chat has nine lives.. People living in glass houses should not!. Boys will be boys You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. Mouth cut trousers nah ah fit Massa.They Brag Most That Can Do the Least Caught between a rock and a hard place. He is an ill companion that has a good memory  
  If dutty ah deh ah roof tap, yuh barrel ah catch am. In the land of hope there is never any winter Walls have ears  A Fool Oct Give a Wise Man Counsel. If the Blind Lead the Blind, Both Shall Fall Into the DitchFools rush in where angels fear to tread. Pardon all but theyself Like the measles, love is most dangerous when it comes late in life A black plum is as sweet as a white. Feed a cold starve a fever 
  A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain. A miss is as good as a mile. He who knows better has never tried it One good turn deserves half the blanketsLaugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone A sprat to catch a mackerel. A disposition towards inquiry deprived the feline of its vital state. Beauty without grace is like a hook without bait. . All good things must come to an end. The older the fiddler, the sweeter the tune. Ill-gotten gains never prosper Look after number one 
  A lie well stuck to is as good as the truth.
