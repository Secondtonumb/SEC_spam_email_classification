Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi . PK - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and 1www02yr4mz8.e80rh1 Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

-----------------------
Under the weather. Wet behind the ears. Stuck in a rut.  Plain as water. The sun will shine into our yard to.   When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Sly as a fox.   Thick as a brick.   Two peas in a pod.  Still waters run deep. To gild refined gold, to paint the lily. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   Sly as a fox.   Slow as a snail.   We hung them out to dry.  Walking on cloud nine. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. Throw pearls before swine. Sweating blood.   Run to seed. 

What goes up must come down. Slow as a snail.   Put to bed with a shovel. You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. What goes down usually comes up.  There may be snow on the roof, but there's fire in the belly. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Salt of the Earth. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  Shake like a leaf. To gild refined gold, to paint the lily. Tall as a tree.   This is for the birds.   The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees. Water under the bridge. Under the weather. You reap what you sow. Read the tea leaves. Sitting on the fence. You never miss the water till the well runs dry. Walking on thin ice. Thick as a brick.   Read the tea leaves.
