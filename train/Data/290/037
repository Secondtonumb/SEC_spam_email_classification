      Like music to my ears Due to the presence of fools, wise people stand out  Least said soonest mended A good beginning makes a good ending.
      Pentium wise; pen and paper foolish. If you lie down with the dogs, you'll.. stink in the morning. Bad news travels fast
    
    
      Seven years nah too much fuh wash speck off ah bird neck.One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters. To know the road ahead, ask those coming back Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget
      In Gates we trust. A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. Confidence is a plant of slow growth There is no physician like a true friend  Be kind to people on the way up, you may need them when you are on your way down Laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone 
    
  
  The spirit is willing but the flesh is weakNever guh a store ah night fuh buy black cloth. Where there's smoke, there's.. pollution. Cold hands, warm heart  Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me Great groups from little icons grow. Virtual reality is its own reward. A hedge between keeps friendship green. He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others A man is known by the company he keeps. Why bark when you can get a dog to do it  Plant the crab tree where you will, it will never bear pippins
