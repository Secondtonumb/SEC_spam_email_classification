      Dead men tell no tales A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the mountain A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog.

      Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport.One good turn deserves another All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life. Take your time and time will take you  Kill two birds with one stone
