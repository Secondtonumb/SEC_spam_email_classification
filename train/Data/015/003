Dear Sir,

 

y name is g4.6rawyh Musere. I hail from the Federal

Republic of Ghana, 52 years old and married with three

children. I am the Diretor of Silver Global Security &Finance

Services Limited, Ghana. I got the information concerningyou from the 

Internet and after due consideration, I decided to contact

you believing that by the Grace of God, you will not

disappoint me over this transaction. I have been working with

this company for over sixteen years.

Within this period, I have watched with meticulous precision how 

AfricanHeads of State and Government functionaries

have been using Silver Global Security & Finance Ltd

to move sums of money (USD, Pounds Sterling, French Francs)

(cash) to their foreign qx73v930.b48t bring in these consignments of

cash and secretly declare the contents as jewelries,

gold, diamonds, precious stones, family treasures,and documents

etc. Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (dead), Gen. Sanni

Abacha of Nigeria (dead), Fode Sankoy of Sierra Leone,Sabimbi the

Late President of Angola, Felix Houphet Boigny of Cote

d"Ivoire (dead)Charles Taylor,Former President of Liberia

website:http://u9kv.z34.co.i5/2/hi/africa/itkp931.b03,

Kanan Bedie of Cote d"Ivoire (Abidjan) etc.

All these people have many consignments deposited with my

j4jqg4.4i16h foreign partners,friends and relatives are

claiming most of these consignments. A

lot of them are lying here unclaimed for as much as three years.

Nobody will ever come for them because in most cases, the

Certificate of Deposit are never available to

anybody except the depositors or me since most of them

are dead. I have through the instrumentality of Global

Security & Finance re-deposited all these unclaimed and

overstayed consignment into the Vault Facility of a

reputable Security Company in 2b75ee.pdn0r the

inception of the year 2000,our company's management

has changed the procedure of claims of 9gypb2d7agl.cr soon as you

are able to produce the secret information as contained in

the secret file of any consignment,it will be released to

you upon demand.I have finalized every arrangement

for you to claim consignment No. 1401, 1402 containing $20.5Million

 

I will supply you with all the information and

documents that will facilitate your easy claim of th 

9gypb2d7agl.tvf5m6op579j9,you can forward your Bank information to me 

if it is not convenient for you to travel,such

that I can in turn forward it to the Security/Finance House

in Europe for onward remmittance of the said sum into

your 20f0h36.tlew your positive reply of this letter,I will

furnish you with further details and information

regarding the modus operandi for the execution of the transaction.

This business is risk free as I have taken necessary

preventive measures.(The mode of sharing will be 50-50),
