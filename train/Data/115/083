The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit  Experience is a great servant Revenge is sweet

      When you live in the past, it costs you the present  An old Ox makes a straight furrow A cat may look at a king. Use soft words and hard arguments Two things a man should never be angry at: what he can help and what he cannot help  He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin
      A positive pessimist is better than a negative optimist. Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea . He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone Beauty without grace is like a hook without bait. . Beware of Greeks bearing gifts 
    
    
      We all get heavier as we get older because there is a lot more information in our heads  Time and tide wait for no man.Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea .
      Think before you speak It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  One mans loss is another mans gain One good turn deserves another Keep your powder dry  Orange yellow but yuh nah know if he sweet. Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep 
    
  
  In April,a youg mans thoughts turn to fancy! Zeal without knowledge is the sister of follyIf you want a place in the sun, you must leave the shade of the family tree Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage  You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb You can't teach an old dog new.. math. Things are not always what they seem. Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. Be just before you are generous
