A user and his leisure time are soon parted. 

  He That Will Not Be Counselled Cannot Be Helped Imagination is the highest kite you can fly Keep your mouth shut and your ears open. Never guh a store ah night fuh buy black cloth. He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty If you would enjoy the fruit, pluck not the flower  The geek shall inherit the earth.A lie well stuck to is as good as the truth. 
  Vex nah gat plaster fuh passion. See Naples and die A chat has nine lives.. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life. Time and tide wait for no man. Genius is an Infinite Capacity for Taking PainsThe early bird catches the worm. A lie well stuck to is as good as the truth. Needs must when the devil drives What we see depends mainly on what we look for  
  Smile and the world smiles with you, snore and you sleep alone God defend me from my friends; from my enemies I can defend myself Things can only get better Who feels guilty, feels responsibleCoin a phrase Christmas comes but once a year A Growing Youth Has a Wolf in His Belly. The best things come in small packages If you are planning for a year - sow rice, if you are planning for a decade - sow trees, if you are planning for a lifetime - educate people Fortune favours the brave The higher you climb up the ladder, the more people can see your arse  
  Spare the rod and spoil the child A tidy house holds a bored woman.A friend to all is a friend to none.  Never murder a man who is committing suicide Fight fire with fire God help the poor, for the rich can help themselves  Is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness A soft answer turneth away wrath. He who is ABSENT is always in the WrongI also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh. 
  Common fame is seldom to blame Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings The stylus is more potent than the claymore. When the wine is in, the wit is out  Every devil has not a cloven hoof For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. Age before beauty What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity 
  Not to know is bad; not to wish to know is worse  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. An idle mind is.. the best way to relax. No wind, no wavesFair exchange is no robbery  The best things in life are free Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat  Give Neither Counsel Nor Salt till You Are Asked For It 
  Spare the rod and spoil the child Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all  A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret.Pain is so close to pleasure If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way. Love is blind. Lear from the past, Live for today Look for tomorrow, take a nap this afternoon A man that breaks his word bids other be false to him. Learn to say no It will be of more use to you than to be able to read Latin  A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog. He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you 
  Modulation in all things.
