Some were labelled LILY. Im closer to death than Ive ever been in my life, he thought, because she means it. 


I found that out pretty quick! Then she picked up propane torch with the word Bernz-0-matiC on it and twisted the valve on the side. And then, as the numbing euphoria of the injection began to spread, he thought almost with humor: Some lousy Scheherazade I turned out to be.
It was this thought more than any other which had seat him out on this cold and windy night, under a moon which stuttered uncertainly between the clouds. If whoever that is hears something ? or even if I hear something and think he might have heard something ? I will kill him, or them, then you, then myself. Then the pattern broke wide open.   If she fell off her husbands bike or drove off one of those unpaved ridge-roads, he did not actually believe he would be fine. Enough so he had gone into what she called respiratory depression at least once.
