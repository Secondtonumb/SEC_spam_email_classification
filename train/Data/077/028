Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the 0pp0rtunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

There may be snow on the roof, but there's fire in the belly. When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Take time to smell the roses. They're like two peas in a pod.  What's done is done.  A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Wrinkled as a prune. Water doesn't run uphill.   We hung them out to dry.  Up one side and down the other.   They're like two peas in a pod.  Up one side and down the other.   She has a green thumb. Were you born in a barn? Stop and smell the roses. Spring forward fall back. Root it out. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  You feel like a fish out of water. To live from hand to mouth. Spring rain, Fall gold. The shoes on the other foot now.  

Up one side and down the other.   Put off the scent.   Shiver me timber. Sweating blood.   Welcome to my garden.  Shit end of the stick. Spill the beans.   Shit happens.   When we love - we grow.  Timber! When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Shit happens.   Walking on cloud nine. Tools of the wq@de.
