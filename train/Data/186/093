Never the twain shall meet  There is a skeleton in every cupboard  

  If Wishes Were Horses, Beggars Would Ride The Best Wine Comes Out of an Old Vessel A cold bitter Christmas, a fat churchyard. Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  Any port in a storm For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.You can have too much of a good thing My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance.  
  Still waters run deep Things are not always what they seem. Every little helps Accidents will happen in the best regulated families. When I turned myself over to God, i took my life out the hands of an idiot It will all come out in the wash As safe as housesCan a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? All good things must come to an end. Where the carcass is, there shall the eagles be gathered together  The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything Trust is the mother of deceit 
  As you make your bed, so must you lie in it Hunger is the best sauce Do as I say, and not as I do He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing Give and spend and God will sendWhen the wine is in, the wit is out  Nah all who guh a church house ah guh fuh pray. The geek shall inherit the earth. Every cross has its inscriptions Books and friends should be few and good Abundance, like want, ruins many. Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. 
  Everyday is a fresh slateHatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs Second place is first loser True love never grows old C:\ is the root of all directories. A cat may look at a Queen. Every little helps Another day, another dollarYou cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds A miss is as good as a mr. 
  Quality is better than quantity  Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer! For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. Every cloud has a silver lining A place for everything and everything in its place. If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport. Baby who ah cry ah house and ah door ah same thing.If you believe everything you read, you better not read One good turn deserves another. When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. When you live in the past, it costs you the present  
  The devil tempts all, but the idle man tempts the devil The best things in life are free A place for everything and everything in its place. Ignorance is blissLend your money and lose your friend Blue are the hills that are far away A miss is as good as a mr. Desperate Diseases Call for Desperate Remedies 
  Every bird loves to hear himself sing Melt the icy fingers of fear with the sunshine of hope C:\ is the root of all directories. Flies never visit an egg that has no crack  Tailors and writers must mind the fashion Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed Cold hands, warm heart  
  The pen is mightier than the sword.
