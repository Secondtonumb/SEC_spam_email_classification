      Greedy folks have long arms  Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to use the Net and he won't bother you for weeks. Learn to say no It will be of more use to you than to be able to read Latin  Penny wise, pound foolish

      Nah mind how pumpkin vine run, he must dry up one day. None but the wearer knows where the shoe pinches To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it The early bird catches the worm.

Nah all who guh a church house ah guh fuh pray. Folly grows without watering
