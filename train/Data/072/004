Dear  Wedend,


I am Prince Musa .B. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Gulf Island of Borneo. 

I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history, which has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his stepbrother, the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah. As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 billion dollars. 

This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office. However my father was kept under house arrest, his ban! k accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate. Furthermore during this unfortunate period, I was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that I was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and I had no access to phone, but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this mail. Some of the guards here are still loyal to me. 

Before my Incaseration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Four hundred and twenty Million United States Dollars (US$420,000,000.00) in cash with the assistance of a foreign diplomat who now reside in Europe.

The money has now been deposited as valuables into different private security and trust company for safe keeping abroad. The money where splited and kept in the following countries in this proportion: US$50 Million is in Lond! on, US$80 Million is in Spain, US$40 Million is in Thailand, US $170 Million is in Cotonuo Republic of Benin and the balance of US$80 Million is in Holland.

Please if you know you can assist in claiming and investing it in real estate/property to guarantee the future survival of my family, contact me fast so that I'll give you contact information of the security company in Europe and other parts of the world where the funds are deposited. For your assistance i will compensate you with 25% of the total sum and another 5% shall be set aside to defray any expenses that may lofsa.bwh87f I count on your absolute confidentiality, transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this business transaction through my email address as follows: 9h7v86gsv0u@hotmail.com


Thanks & Oct Allah's blessing remain with you.

Prince Musa .B. Bolkiah
