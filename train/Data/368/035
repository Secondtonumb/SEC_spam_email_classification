Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

-----------------------
When the cows come home.  Some like carrots others like cabbage. The sun will shine into our yard to.   Root it out. Watch and wait.  Stand your ground. When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) She has a green thumb. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Sweating blood.   Wet behind the ears. Putting the cart before the horse. Putting it in a nutshell.   Where man is not nature is barren. Putting it in a nutshell.   A tree does not move unless there is wind.  

That's a whole new can of worms.   Some like carrots others like cabbage. Too little too late.   To rule the mountains is to rule the river.   You can't teach an old dog new tricks.  Speak softly and carry a big stick.   Putting the cart before the horse. Water it down.  Two peas in a pod.  When we love - we grow.  The sharper is the berry, the sweeter is the wine. Putting the cart before the horse. Seed money. A thorn in my side.   A snail's pace. Raking in the dough. What goes down usually comes up.  As uneasy as a cat near water.   Water it down.
