Joke: You'll Farz Your Guts Out 
Bob and Martha have been married for 25 years. Every morning for 25 years, Bob wakes up, farts loudly, rolls over onto his back and gets up for work.  
Every morning for 25 years, Martha says, "One of these days, you're gonna fart your guts out!"  
One Thanksgiving morning, Martha is preparing the turkey and gets an idea. Before her husband gets up, she creeps upstairs and places the turkey innards in his pajama bottoms, giggling to herself. 
Well, later that morning, Bob wakes up and goes through his morning ritual. He screams as he goes running into the 
bathroom. Martha laughs, but is concerned after noticing that Bob has been in the bathroom for almost an hour.  
She runs upstairs, and is about to knock on the door, when Bob opens up, pale as a ghost. He says, "You were right. You were right. I did fart my guts out, but by the grace of God and these two fingers I got them back up there again."
