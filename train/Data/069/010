      A black plum is as sweet as a white. For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil. If Wishes Were Horses, Beggars Would Ride Where there's a will, there's a relative. What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts If you are planning for a year - sow rice, if you are planning for a decade - sow trees, if you are planning for a lifetime - educate people
      Abundance, like want, ruins many. What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive Actions speak louder than words. There are always ears on the other side of the wall 
    
    
      A proverb never lies, it is only its meaning which deceives. A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. Whatever can go wrong, will go wrongHe who dares wins
      Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  Never speak ill of the dead  A fool will laugh when he is drowning. Too many clicks spoil the browse  Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick  A whistling women and a crowing hen are neither fit for God or men. You do well to believe in God Wedan also believes and trembles 
    
  
  One man's meat is another man's poison..Sympathy without relief is like mustard without beef Only when all contribute their firewood can they build up a strong fire Divide and rule He that plants a tree plants for posterity The West Wind Always Brings Wet Weather, The East Wind Wet and Cold Together, the South Wind Surely Brings Us Rain, the North Wind Blows It Back Again Revenge is a dish best served cold. Faith will move mountains Mother knows best Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. Wedends are made by many acts - and lost by only one
