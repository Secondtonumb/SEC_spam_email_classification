I write to inform you of my intention to invest in a Hotel or any other business in your country .

I have (US$12,000,000.00) that I deposited this in a Finance company outside the country for this project, 
AND 30% WILL BE FOR YOU WHY 70% WILL BE FOR ME WHICH YOU WILL TO START THE HOTLE PROJECT ON MY BEHALF.
