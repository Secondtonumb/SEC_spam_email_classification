We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. Opportunities always look bigger going than coming

      Softly, softly, catchee monkey  Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit  Unkissed, unkind
      Look good, feel good Once seen never forgotten The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him
    
    
      All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest  When poverty comes in at the door, love flies out of the window If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause. No Good Building Without a Good Foundation
      Gentle is that gentle does  The Fairest Rose at Last is Withered Fish are no respectors of human boredom, so why go angling Chaste makes waste. Curiosity killed the cat. 
    
  
  In for a penny, in for a pound Dont count the days, make the days count!Never judge someone until you have travelled a mile in their shoes A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  What goes up must come down He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son  To err is human, to forgive divine After dinner rest a while, after supper walk a mile
