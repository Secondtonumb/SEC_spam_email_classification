Best of Both Worlds Movies

Being A Woman 
Everyday I give thanks to the Goddess,
I have two mounds upon my bodice.
I shave my legs, I sit down to pee.
I can justify any shopping spree.
Not to a barber, but a beauty salon
Can get a massage without a hard on.
Can balance the checkbook, pump my own gas.
Can talk to my friends about the size of my azs.
I always save money by using coupons.
Can admit to others when I am wrong.
Don't drive in circles at any cost,
So I don't have to admit when I am lost.
Don't act like I'm in a timed marathon
Every time I go to the john.
Let me tell you men, listen to me boys...
Those things in your pants that you treat as toys...
You love them more then we ever will.
We would rather suck on a cold pickled dill.
I spend two hours preparing for a date,
Only to find you're two hours late.
I don't watch movies with lots of gore.
Don't need instant replay to remember the score.
I won't lose my hair, I don't get jock itch
And just cause I'm assertive, don't call me a bitch.
I don't wear the same underwear everyday.
The food in my fridge has no sign of decay.
I don't go to Sears to look at the tools.
I don't cheat at poker, I follow the rules. 
I don't smoke cigars.
Don't pay for drinks at bars.
I don't punch my friends just to say "Hi"
And it's o.k. for me to cry.
I know all you men
Think that you're "IT",
But compared to a woman
You just ain't SHIT!  
 


Glass Eye 
A man is dining in a fancy restaurant, and there is a gorgeous redhead sitting at the next table. He had been checking her out since he sat down, but lacked the nerve to talk with her.
Suddenly she sneezes and her glass eye comes flying out of its socket towards the man. He reflexively reaches out, grabs it out of the air, and hands it back.
"Oh my, I am so sorry," the woman says as she pops her eye back in place. "Let me buy you dessert to make it up to you."
They enjoy a wonderful dessert together, and afterwards, the woman invites him to the theater followed by drinks. After paying for everything, she asks him if he would like to come to her place for a nightcap...and stay for breakfast the next morning.
The next morning, she cooks a gourmet meal with all the trimmings. The guy is amazed! Everything has been incredible!
"You know," he said, "you are the perfect woman. Are you this nice to every guy you meet?"
"No," she replies...
 "You just happened to catch my eye."
