      Let bygones be bygones A good tree brings forth good fruit.
      The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence Use soft words and hard arguments
    
    
      You can only go as far as you pushEvery dog has his day Out of the frying pan and into the fire .
      The stick is the surest peacemaker To thine own self be true Bush get ears and dutty get tongue. 
    
  
  Nothing is interesting if you are not interested  The stick is the surest peacemakerHe is always right who suspects that he makes mistakes Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. Old habits die hard The nearer to the church, the farther from God Time wounds all heels. Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. An idle mind is.. the best way to relax.
