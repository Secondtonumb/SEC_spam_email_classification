Dear Lan, 

Thank you very much for your request. I am more than happy to consider the
idea of a joint paper. 

According to the proposed book you discussed with Marco Di Tommaso, my
interest is for chapter 25 (growth strategies of firms) or chapter 11
(business group governance). On these chapters I send you a file with some
preliminary notes. 

The best think is that you keep discussing with Marco Di Tommaso the overall
arrangement for the book, specifically the attribution of chapters. Marco is
going to send you a proposal in the following weeks. 

After we have agreed on the joint work I confirm my willingness to come and
visit you to start and discussing in details the joint paper.  

 

Best regards.

cooperate with you in writing a paper on business groups. We hope you would
accept the invitation, and it is our pleasure.

 

Hence, Prof. Lan would like to invite you to select a topic for the joined
paper. In order to let it go fluently, Prof. Lan asked me to send you his
resume and it may help you to learn more about Prof. Lan's research field.
Then, the joined paper would be in some field that is in common. 

 

According to the time schedule of the book proposal, we should provide the
abstract of the paper before Oct 15th. So if you have some idea or topic
that is posible, please inform us as soon as posible, and we may carry out
the writing the joined paper right now. Thank you very much!
