      If a son is uneducated, his dad is to blame If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause. If practice makes perfect and nobody's perfect then why practice?.
      A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions. One volunteer is worth ten pressed men A faithful friend is a medicine for life. A best friend is like a four leaf clover, Hard to find and lucky to have. Children should be seen and not heard
    
    
      Nah every crab hole get crab.	 It is good to have company in miseryTherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
      In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom The bigger they are, the harder they fall  
    
  
  Time and tide wait for no man.The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him God is alive and well and working on something less ambitious Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds. There is illumination at the termination of the subterranean excavation. Never judge a book by its cover A lender nor borrower be.  A fool and his money are soon parted. If Fortune calls, offer him a seat  A Good Example is the Best Sermon. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
