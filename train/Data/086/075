      Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword 
      We all get heavier as we get older because there is a lot more information in our heads  Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Wise children have short years
    
    
      Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world A Good Example is the Best Sermon. A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains.
      If oil ah float watah deh ah battam.	 Death is the great leveller Only fools and horses work  Mind your own business Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it 
    
  
  Silence is golden. I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger  Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble When you become successful in any type of life, there are people who are not contributing to the motion True love never grows old Past cure, past care If you lie down with dogs you will come up with fleas  Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched . Birds of a feather flock together. He knows best what good is that has endured evil  Opportunity makes a thief It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.
