      A good man is hard to find. The pot calls the kettle black. Better wed over the mixen than over the moor
      Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded. Never say die The pen is mightier than the sword Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity 
    
    
      Caught between a rock and a hard place. It takes all sorts to make a world Every bush a man night time.Second place is first loser as strong as love A penny saved makes Jack a dull boy.
      Everyone stretches his legs according to the length of his coverlet A faithful friend is a medicine for life. Keep your friends close but your enemies closer Practice makes perfect. No good carpenter does get good wuk bench. Ignorance is bliss Better to be safe than.. punch a 5th grader. 
    
  
  Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  Boys will be boys Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside  Youth nah ah weary but he ah fall down. It is foolish to deal with a fool There but for the grace of God go I  If cow-man pass wild meat whah mek me must pick up am. A place for everything and everything in its place. The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  Although the Wed Oct Shine, Leave Not Thy Cloak at Home
