Harry received a slight shock; blinking down at him from every direction
was Siriuss face. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs - even the one
of Sirius being best man at the Potters wedding -papered the walls. The
only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins

parchment into his hand. I need as much information as possible on
flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. Weve received
information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.
Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, Give him
the magazine, he might find it interesting. Then he said in normal
tones, And dont take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs
report held our investigation up for a month.Hi,
