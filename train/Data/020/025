      Laughter is the closest distance between two people Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings Attack is the best form of defence
      Strangers are just friends you have not met yet Love is the strangest thing Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see  Better to be alone than in bad company 
    
    
      The proof of the pudding is in the eatingA fair exchange is no robbery.
      To many people in a dustbin means there not much room in side Lucky at cards, unlucky in love After dark all cats are leopards 
    
  
  When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh.Pain is so close to pleasure Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it  Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  Once bitten twice shy  A good tree brings forth good fruit. Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? Age is a very high price to pay for maturity
