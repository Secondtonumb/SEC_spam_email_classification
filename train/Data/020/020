      Home is where you hang your hat No man is a hero to his valet
      There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem  Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem 
    
    
      We all get heavier as we get older because there is a lot more information in our heads A friend to all is a friend to none.

  Man strength deh ah he hand, woman strength deh a she mouth.Robbing Peter to pay Paul When good cheer is lacking, our friends will be packing Love is like a fire, it can either warm your heart or burn your house down A good tree brings forth good fruit. Curses, like chickens, come home to roost Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from a friends forehead Think before you speak
