Subject: Urgent - Wed Partner Advantage Program, for Independent Software Vendors - Annual Review 

Dear М┬  ль,

Time is running out! Don't risk losing program benefits.

We sent you a notice a month ago, but our records indicate that you haven't completed the Annual Review of your company, contact and product information. Failure to do so within 25 days of receipt of this notice will result in suspension of your benefits. 

Please note that if you don't complete your Annual Review, your products will have to be removed from the Wed Partner Products Catalog until we can confirm the accuracy of the information we have on file. 

Suspension also means that everyone else in your company will be prevented from participating in the many free, low cost technology, marketing, education and discount development hardware offerings for which your company may be eligible.

Simple Process - Do It Now.

1. Visit the Wed Partner Advantage Program Membership Center [link to http://79e.com/partners/isv] and log in with your Company ID or email address and password.

2. In the Partners Notices section, click on "Complete Your Annual Review". 

3. You will be presented with the Annual Review introduction page. Start the review process by clicking on the "Next" button.
