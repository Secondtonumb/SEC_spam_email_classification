He That Teaches Himself has a Fool for his Master Ill-gotten gains never prosper 

  He who knows better has never tried it Agree, For The Law is Costly A guilty conscience needs no accuser.  Work is the curse of the drinking classes He That Brings Good News Knocks Hard Do as I say, and not as I do If practice makes perfect and nobody's perfect then why practice?. One who has the reputation of an early riser may safely lie in bed until noon Is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness Laughter is the closest distance between two people 
  In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is King Fate leads the willing but drives the stubborn To know the road ahead, ask those coming back Your troubles seem larger the longer you look at them Quality is better than quantity  A fool gives; a wise man takes. Civility costs nothingBetter to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all  Charity begins at home Keep your mouth shut and your ears open. Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. 
  Least said soonest mended If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way. A leopard cannot change its spots. Everything must have a beginningA hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. Revenge is a dish best served cold There is a time to speak and a time to be silent There are always ears on the other side of the wall  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. 
  Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?Good talk saves the food The eyes are the window of the soul Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. Good fences make good neighbours! Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan Many people know how to say nothing; few know when Every cross has its inscriptions When two big bottle deh ah table lil one nah business deh.There is a time and a place for everything 
  The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth When coconut fall from tree he can't fasten back. To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. Who feels guilty, feels responsible Eat well, stay fit, die anyway Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea . He who awaits much receives little A faithful friend is a medicine for life.Don't mind how bird vex, it can't vex with tree. Once bitten twice shy  Never judge a book by its cover 
  God defend me from my friends; from my enemies I can defend myself Time and tide wait for no man. Old friends and wine are best None so deaf as those who will not hear  There is more than one way to skin a cat Never judge a book by its cover. If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip.  
  We do not care of what we have, but we cry when it is lost Age is a very high price to pay for maturityWhen the wine is in, the wit is out  The Mills of God Grind Slowly, Yet They Grind Exceedingly Small They that dance must pay the fiddler A proverb never lies, it is only its meaning which deceives. The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  To err is human, to forgive divine Strangers are just friends you have not met yet 
  Curses, like chickens, come home to roost
