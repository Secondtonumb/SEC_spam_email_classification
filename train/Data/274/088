      Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs Folly grows without watering One who has the reputation of an early riser may safely lie in bed until noon  The female of the species is more deadly than the male Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse
      Plant the crab tree where you will, it will never bear pippins  Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded. A man is at his tallest when he stoops to help a child. All roads lead to Rome
    
    
      To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart  To deceive oneself is very easyA good lawyer must be a great liar. Death is the great leveller Procrastination is the thief of time
      Laughter is the best medicine. The first step is the hardest. Never play leapfrog with a unicorn  My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance.  Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. Speed thrills. 
    
  
  People living in glass houses should not pelt stones.Pain is temporary, victory is forever  The horses of hope gallop, but the asses of experience go slowly When fortune smiles, embrace her If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip.  A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions. Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  Never look a gift horse in the mouth Six of one, half a dozen of the other . Be first at the feast, and last at the fight Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded.
