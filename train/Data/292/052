He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin

      All are not cooks that walk with long knives It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  Night is the Mother of Counsel Old fish and young flesh feed men best Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you
      Practice makes perfect and Nobody's perfect. Daddies know best It takes one bad apple to spoil the barrel! A great dowry is a bed full of brambles. 
    
    
      Fine words butter no parsnips  When good cheer is lacking, our friends will be packingGood broth may be made in an old pot
      The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything The nearer to the church, the farther from God He that knows nothing, doubts nothing Actions speak louder than words. 
    
  
  A disposition towards inquiry deprived the feline of its vital state.A man's home is his castle. Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company  And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. The eyes are the window of the soul It is good to have company in misery It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease. A lender nor borrower be.  What flares up fast, extinguishes soon It will all come right in the wash When the student is ready, the master will appear  A closed mouth gathers no feet.  Many hands make light work Life is just a bowl of cherries.
