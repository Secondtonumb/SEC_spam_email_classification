Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery Caught between a rock and a hard place. 

  When yuh deh in bad luck wet paper self ah cut yuh. A creaking door hangs longest. The e-mail of the species is more deadly than the mail. A proverb is a true word. A leopard cannot change its spots. There's no fool like an old fool.The eyes are the window of the soul A friend in need is a friend indeed. 
  There is more than one way to skin a cat First come, first served  Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves  The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. War does not always decide who it right but it always decides who is left! Everything comes to him who waitsRain ah fall ah roof yuh put barrel fuh ketch am. Curiosity killed the cat Better to be safe than.. punch a 5th grader. All lay loads on a willing horse! 
  You are a long time dead One man money mek too much man cry. A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourselfFootball is a game of two halves When yuh play out all yuh trump cards yuh gat to lose till game done. Where there's a will, there's a way. Man cannot live on bread alone Never stand on the tail of a hedgehog after midnight A cat may look at a Queen. Out of sight, out of mind 
  The Best Wine Comes Out of an Old Vessel Rain before seven, fine before eleven United we stand, divided we fall  Faith will move mountains. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Knowing is not enough; We must Apply Willing is not enough; We must Do All the world loves a lover Every best friend get a next best friend. The best advice is found on the pillow To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. God made the country and man made the town!Fish and cast-net nah friend. 
  Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside  When I turned myself over to God, i took my life out the hands of an idiot Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious. Jack of all trades, master of none Time and tide wait for no man Sleep is better than medicineSometimes the majority only means all the fools are on the same side But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . 
  He who awaits much receives little But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Pardon all but theyselfAn apple a day keeps the doctor at bay Judge not that you be not judged Coin a phrase Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree 
  C:\ is the root of all directories. A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. A wonder lasts but nine days.Yuh can't drink mauby and belch beer. Rain ah fall ah roof yuh put barrel fuh ketch am. The pot calls the kettle black Happiness is wanting what you have - not having what you want There is no difference between a wise man and a fool when they fall in love It is in vain to cast your net where there is no fish  Diligence is the mother of good fortune 
  Life is just a bowl of cherries. Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing
