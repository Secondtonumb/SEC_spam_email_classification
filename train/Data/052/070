Ulster Bank Limited

Isle of Man.



Dear Wedend,

 

I am Mr. Arthur Molloy the Bank Manager of Ulster Bank Limited, Isle of Man. 

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 


On September  4, 2001; Mr. Trbalo Vicente , a National of France, who used to be a private contractor with the Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Mr. Trbalo

Vicente Made a Numbered time (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at GBP?0, 000,000.00 (Thirty

illion Pounds only) in my Branch. 


Upon maturity in 2004, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia that Mr. g4.dr96pu Vicente And his wife with their three children

were involved in an auto crash, and all occupants of the vehicle Lost their Life.


On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further

investigation and discovered that Mr. Trbalo Vicente did not declare any next of kin or Relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit

paperwork in my Bank. The sum of GBP?0,000,000.00 have been floating as unclaimed since 2001 in my bank

as all efforts to get his relatives have hit the stones. According to the Isle of Man or British law at

the expiration of 25 (FIVE) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund and the FIVE years is the end of September 2006.

 

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 25 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to

the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at GBP?0,000,00000 can be transferred/paid to b91.h52b will be disbursed or shared in these percentages, 60% to me and 40% to you. 

 

 I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest Co-operation, Confidentiality and A trust to enable us sees this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a

legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me urgently by E-mail and Provide me with the following; 

 

1. Full Name

2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number

3. Your Contact Address.

4. Your Age.

 

Your urgent response will be highly anticipated and appreciated.
