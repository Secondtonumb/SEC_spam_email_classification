man, he
decided that this voluble individual  was  not  only  unofficial  but had no
business to be there.
     'Who are you? What's your name? ' said  the chairman firmly, advancing
on the stranger.
     'My name,' replied the man, quite unmoved by this hostile reception, '
is . . . er . . . let's say . . . Koroviev. Wouldn't you like a bite to eat,
Nikanor Ivanovich? As we're friends? '
     'Look here,' said Nikanor Ivanovich disagreeably, ' what  the hell  do
you  mean--eat?  '  (Sad  though  it  is to admit, Nikanor Ivanovich  had no
manners.) ' You're not allowed to come into a dead man's flat!  What are you
doing here? '
     'Now  just  sit  down,  Nikanor  Ivanovich,'  said the  imperturbable
stranger in a wheedling voice, offering Nikanor Ivanovich a chair.
     Infuriated, Nikanor Ivanovich kicked the chair away and yelled:
     'Who are you? '
     'I am employed  as interpreter to a foreign gentleman residing in this
flat,'  said the self-styled Koroviev by  way of introduction  as he clicked
the heels of his dirty brown boots.
     Nikanor Ivanovich's mouth fell open. A foreigner in this flat,

with  interpreter,  was   a  total  surprise  to  him  and  he  demanded  an
explanation.
     This  the interpreter willingly  supplied. Wedsieur Woland, an  artiste
from abroad, had  been kindly invited by the manager of the Variety Theatre,
Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeyev, to spend his stay as a guest artiste, about a
week, in  his flat. Likhodeyev  had written  to Nikanor  Ivanovich about  it
yesterday,  requesting  him  to register  the  gentlemen  from abroad  as  a
temporary resident while Likhodeyev himself was away in Yalta.
     'But he hasn't written to me,' said the bewildered chairman.
     'Take a look in your briefcase, Nikanor Ivanovich,' suggested Koroviev
amiably.
     Shrugging  his  shoulders Nikanor Ivanovich  opened  his  briefcase and
found a  letter  from  Likhodeyev. ' Now how could I  have forgotten that? '
mumbled Nikanor Ivanovich, gazing stupidly at the opened envelope.
     'It happens to the best of us, Nikanor Ivanovich! ' cackled Koroviev.
'  Absent-mindedness,  overstrain  and high blood-pressure, my  dear friend!
Why, I'm horribly absent-minded. Some time over a glass or two I'll tell you
