of a climbing vine,  a  plate of potage  printaniere looking like  a  golden
stain on the snow-white table-cloth? Do you remember, Ambrose? But of course
you do--I can see from your lips you remember. Not just your salmon or  your
perch either--what about the snipe,  the woodcock in season,  the quail, the
grouse? And the sparkling wines! But I digress, reader.
     At half past ten on the evening that Berlioz died at Patriarch's Ponds,
only one upstairs  room  at  Griboyedov  was  lit.  In  it sat twelve  weary
authors, gathered for a meeting and still waiting for Mikhail Alexandrovich.
Sitting  on  chairs,  on  tables and  even  on the two  window  ledges,  the
management  committee  of  MASSOLIT was  suffering  badly from  the heat and
stuffiness. Not a single fresh breeze penetrated the open window. Moscow was
