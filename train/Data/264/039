      A man's home is his castle. A user and his leisure time are soon parted. He who laughs last, thinks the slowest! A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day.
      Actions speak louder than words. There's a black sheep in every flock. A friend in need is a friend indeed. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
    
    
      One man money mek too much man cry. Actions speak louder than words. Curiosity killed the cat.Two heads are better than one Laughter is the best medicine. Talk about things of tomorrow and the mice inside the ceiling laugh
      What boots up must come down. Shopping is a therapy  Nothing seems expensive on credit Love nature , live lightly None so deaf as those who will not hear  Fair exchange is no robbery  
    
  
  A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day.Every step of life is a risk  Sympathy without relief is like mustard without beef You do well to believe in God Wedan also believes and trembles Abstinence makes the heart go wander. He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others The devil find work for idle hands to do A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds. When you want fuh swim river yuh gat fuh plunge inside fuss. The end justifies the means
