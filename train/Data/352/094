Dear Confidant,

Greetings,

This mail may come to you as a surprise but I plead with you to patiently
read through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not. I am
r. Steven Masana ( FCAA) the chief accountant of Africa Development Bank
(ADB).  I am making this contact with you base on the need of an
individual/company who may be willing to assist us in the transfer of some
huge sum of money into a foreign bank account.

First and foremost, I apologize using this medium to reach you for a
transaction of this magnitude but this is due to confidential purpose and
prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want
to count on you, as a respected and honest person to handle this
transaction with kind care and sincerity. I have decided to solicit your
assistance in executing  the transaction describe under; which I  believe 
will  be of  benefit to both parties if treated with utmost trust and
confidentiality that it deserve.

A fixed deposit account was opened in my bank in 1999 by one of our main
customer (Mr. Smith B. Andrea) who was a foreigner, a miner at Kruger Gold
Company, and a Geologist by profession, the length of time for the
maturity of the fixed deposit was six years, which expired towards the
ending of last year. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his
forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, a reminder was also sent and finally we discovered from his
Contract employers - The South African Mining Corporation that the
Depositor died since 2000. On further investigation, I found out that the
depositor/beneficiary actually died in a plane crash, in Oct 2000 and he
left nobody as next-of-kin to claim this money. All efforts made to trace
any known relations of his proved abortive, and no one has written our
bank in this regard.

Hence, this said money is still lying in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. Now it?s clear
no one will ever come forward to claim it. And according to the Laws of
the Republic of South Africa, the money will revert to the ownership of
The South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

 All modalities for the successful transfer of this money into an offshore
bank account have been put in place and we are looking for a trust worthy
foreign partner into whose bank account this fund would be remitted to
and in this regard my colleague has mandated me to provide a partner who
will assist us. The amount involve is Twenty Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars (US$20,500,00Million) . We have agreed to
compensate you with 25% of the total amount if you should accept to
assist us.


If you are interested in giving us the required assistance, kindly reply
this email stating your Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because
of the secrecy surrounding this transaction, I suggest that you contact me
only through this e-mail, until further notice.

I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you soon. Feel free to ask
any question in this regard.

I remain,
Yours Faithfully,
r. Steven Masana
