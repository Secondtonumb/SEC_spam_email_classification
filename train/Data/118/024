Purchase of Stocks!


Hello,

I am the branch manager of Mega Bank, Sao 
Tome & Principe PLC. A few years ago, Mega Bank was very liquid and its 
shares commanded respect in the Sao Tome & Principe Stock Exchange. In 
fact, a fast growing and vibrant 8cji.pln its Chairman and Directors 
siphoned the bank liquid reserves to fund their lavish lifestyles, 
buying expensive real estate properties all over the world, this caused 
ega bank to be liquidated under the bankruptcy laws of Sao Tome & 
Principe on June 26th 2006.


I have worked for years for Mega Bank for 
years and I am entitled to provide a pension for myself and my family. 
Therefore, I have perfected a plan to invest a minimum of USD18 million 
abroad. I intend to purchase one or more of the following as a long 
term investment plan:

1. Placement in a bank or financial institution.
2. Purchase of Real Estate properties.
3. Purchase of Stocks in good 
performing companies.
4. Outright purchase of good performing 
companies.

You could be my partner and earn legitimately 20% of the 
fund. Are you interested? If so, please reply and forward immediately 
your contact details.

a. Your complete address.
b. Your Telephone and 
fax numbers.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you all the 
details you may need. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of 
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the successful 
transfer of the funds. 

You should contact me immediately as soon as 
you receive this letter for more explanations

Sincerely,
David Green
