Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and 1www02yr4mz8.e80rh1 Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

Shit happens.   Timing is everything.  Raking it in.  Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow. She has a green thumb. Timber! You reap what you sow. Your ass is grass. The season of goodwill.   What on earth? Your name is mud.  Ugly as a mud fence. Treat him like dirt. What goes down usually comes up.  She's a nut.   Water under the bridge. Put to bed with a shovel. Tastes like chicken.   Wait and see.  Too little too late.   Stop, look and listen. What goes up must come down. Run to seed. 

Welcome to my garden.  There may be snow on the roof, but there's fire in the belly. Some like carrots others like cabbage. Stand your ground. Say it with flowers.   You say potayto, I say potahto. Put off the scent.   A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Rare as walking on water.  Useless as tits on bull.   Put to bed with a shovel. Sweet as honey.   Speak softly and carry a big stick.   What's done is done.  You reap what you sow. Turn over a new leaf. Too little too late.   Put to bed with a shovel. Useless as tits on bull.   Too little too late.   Turn over a new leaf. A tree does not move unless there is wind.   You say potayto, I say potahto. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Stir up an ant's nest.
