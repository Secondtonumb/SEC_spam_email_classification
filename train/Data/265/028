      Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded. A man is known by the company he keeps. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Birds of a feather flock together.
      Lookers on see most of the game Diligence is the mother of good fortune
    
    
      Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. Keep your powder dry Manners maketh man We had nothing to do and we did it very well
