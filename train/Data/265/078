songs of the dwarf-kings of the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race 
of Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of 
Dale. Some sang too that Thror and Thrain would come back one day and 
gold would flow in rivers through the mountain-gates, and all that land 
would be filled with new song and new laughter. But this pleasant legend
did not much affect their daily business.Hi,
