      as delicate as a baby's eye lashes When yuh play out all yuh trump cards yuh gat to lose till game done. There is no physician like a true friend 
    
    
      To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world Every man has his price To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding.
      One man's meat is another man's poison.. A constant guest is never welcome. Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  In the coldest flint there is hot fire If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. .
