It is my fault that Sirius died, said Dumbledore clearly. Or should I
say, almost entirely my fault - I will not be so arrogant as to claim
responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever and energetic
man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while
they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have
believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to
the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry,
as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that
Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you
would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would
not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me
alone.
Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware
of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet
barely understanding what he was hearing.
Please sit down, said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request.Hi,
