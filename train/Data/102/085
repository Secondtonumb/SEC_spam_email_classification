Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

-----------------------
There's no time like the present.   Under the weather. A stepping stone to. A tree does not move unless there is wind.   We hung them out to dry.  Sitting on the fence. A stick in the mud.   The sun will shine into our yard to.   Sour as a green apple.   Too little too late.   The season of goodwill.   Worked night and day. Useless as tits on bull.   The scythe ran into a stone. Useless as tits on bull.   That's a whole new can of worms.   Slow as a snail.   Seed money. She's a nut.   Sour as a green apple.   Put that in your pipe and smoke it.  

To gild refined gold, to paint the lily. Stuck in a rut.  Your barking up the wrong tree. A place in the sun.   Raking in the dough. Sow much, reap much; sow little, reap little. We hung them out to dry.  Sitting on the fence. Till the cows come home.   The shoes on the other foot now.   The sharper is the berry, the sweeter is the wine. When we love - we grow.  To gild refined gold, to paint the lily. Spill the beans.   A place in the sun.   Sitting on the fence. You feel like a fish out of water. Spring forward fall back. The scum of the earth.
