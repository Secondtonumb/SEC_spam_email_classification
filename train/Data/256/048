Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I
needn't argue with that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more
popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first -- rock and roll or
Christianity. Once you attempt legislation upon religious grounds, you open
the way for every kind of intolerance and religious persecution. All your
Western theologies, the whole mythology of them, are based on the concept of
God as a senile delinquent.

It is a heretic that makes the fire, not she which burns
in it. The son of God is the same as the son of man; the son of man is the
same as the son of God. God, the father, is the same as Christ, the son;
Christ, the son, is the same as God, the father. This language may appear
confused to unbelievers, but Christians will readily understand it. If
ignorance of nature gave birth to gods, knowledge of nature is made for
their destruction.
