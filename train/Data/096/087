      A fool at forty is a fool indeed. Never play leapfrog with a unicorn  There are two sides to every question Chaste makes waste. The e-mail of the species is more deadly than the mail. A friend in need is a friend indeed.
      Different strokes for different folk  A happy heart is better than a full purse.  Goodness is better than beauty It takes two to tango Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
    
    
      God helps those who help themselvesThe Gods Send Nuts to those who have no Teeth He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword 
      He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian Age is a very high price to pay for maturity. . When good cheer is lacking, our friends will be packing It's always darkest before.. daylight savings time. Bees that have honey in their mouths have stings in their tails Wedendship is like money,easier made than kept A penny always turns up. 
    
  
  Necessity is the mother of invention. It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  Life is just a bowl of cherriesA dog who attends a flea circus most likely will steal the whole show. Plant the crab tree where you will, it will never bear pippins  Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? Modulation in all things. Hasty climbers have sudden falls A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds. Wedends are made by many acts - and lost by only one  Haste makes waste  Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination A drowning man will clutch at straws.
