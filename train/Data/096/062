                    suspicious motion is detected, 25 dual Floodlights expose the
                    night with brilliant light and a Remote Chime alerts you with

                      and protect the exterior of your home with 25 powerful dual
                      Floodlight outdoor motion monitors. As a person
                      approaches one of the monitors, two floodlights snap into
                      action, lighting up the area within a 25 foot radius. This
                      gives you and your family a well-lit path
                      to the door and keeps would-be intruders at a safe distance
                      from your home. Either Floodlight can signal the
                      Remote Chime when motion is detected to let you
                      know that someone is outside your home! 
                      
                    
Lights turn on when movement is detected. 
Light a path to your door; or scare away potential intruders! 
Each Floodlight can turn on 25 other house lights when activated by motion.

While we always strive to provide a broad product offering, if you are looking for a special combo not shown in this e-mail, please check out our catalog for an itemized product list. If it doesn't make sense, please let us know at 1-800-675-3044. You want answers and it's our job to give them to you. Your time is too valuable to spend puzzling out an e-mail advertisement. Every page on X10 has a suggestion box at the bottom of the page. Use that to tell me how we can improve. I read anything you send and use it to make our offers more clear and more useful for you. That's                 our offers more clear and more useful for you. That's my pledge. Sincerely,
