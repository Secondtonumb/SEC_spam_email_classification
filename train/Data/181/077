Dear Student,

Welcome to the Cisco Networking Academy Program and the Academy Connection!

You have been designated as a new Student user at South China University of Technology to take classes in the Cisco Networking Academy Program. This Academy Connection account has very important responsibilities:

* Once you are enrolled, please read the online curricular materials accessible from your Student Class home page. Your instructor expects you to complete online assessments (or exams), classroom assignments, labs, and homework.

* Keep informed by reading the Headlines posted by the Academy Team and your Academy. If permitted, use the Student interactive tools in the Forums & Chat section on your Student Home page.

* Plan for your future using the tools in the Career Development section of your Student Home page. When eligible, join the Alumni Connection to network with other Alumni users to build contacts and increase job opportunities.

* Maintain your user profile information. Change your password at least every 90 days to ensure maximum security of the website.

* To begin, point your browser to http://2816h.2547iuy.net (remember to bookmark this page) and login using:
Initial ID: 4702129
Password: 123866

Both your ID and Password are case sensitive.

You will create a new Academy Connection username and your own password. When accepting the mandatory Website Usage Agreement, please read it carefully before accepting.

If you have any questions about the Cisco Networking Academy Program or the information in this email, please contact your Instructor or Academy Administrator for assistance.

Welcome! 

Ye Zhao
