I am g4.2bo64 c.1.6jucir Branch Manager National Bank of Dubai Abu
Dhabi branch, I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for
you.A British Oil consultant and contractor with the Kruger Gold
Company,Mr. Raymond Beck made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve
calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification
to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck died in
a plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Beck died in a
plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air crash
(for more information about this crash and person you can contact this

Since we got this information about his death and on further
investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to
trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further
investigationand discovered that Mr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or

relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork in my Bank.

This money is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each b05q.08 one will ever
come forward to claim it. According to Laws of United Arab Emirates, at
the expiration of 25 (Eight) years, the money will revert to the
ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this
old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
h8h4906vl.h52b is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and
notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of

probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in
any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.

The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio
of 60% for me and 40% for b91.c1boh is no risk at all as all the
paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as
the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this

transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require
