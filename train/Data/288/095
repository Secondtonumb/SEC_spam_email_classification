ENGR,JACOB AGBAHEDE,
BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO,

y name is "Jacob Agbahede , a member of the Presidential
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year
there was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta
Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the
communities c01z3u7l.n0k contract was handled by a
foreign firm but because of the huge monetary profit
we envisaged we decided to over-invoice the contract sum.

Now the contract has been completed and the original
contractor has since been paid,but the contract
balance of US$38.6 million,which resulted from the over
invoiced contract sum that has been left in a suspense
account with the CENTRAL BANK of NIGERIA,is what me
and my partners are planning to take out of the
country for 8693ax8h7.n0k problem is as government
officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank
accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.

To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this
amount into your account. We are ready to share this
money with you on the basis of participation. We also
have plans to invest part of this money in any viable
business in your country under your care,as we are
nearing our retirement age. 
In any case, I got your contact through network on 
line hence decided to write you if you can assist us on 
this transaction. Please if you accept my proposal do 
not hesitate to contact me immediately via email
so that I can provide you with the basic procedures 
for the release of the fund.

It does not matter whether you or your company does
contract project of the nature described here, the
assumption is that you won a major contract and
subcontracted it to another company, more often than
not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated
field win major contracts here in Nigeria and
subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution.

BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall
remit this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the
entire funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while
5% has been set aside to cover any expenses that may
be incurred by both parties during this transaction,
both local and international.

Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with
utmost degree of maturity and confidentiality because
I am still in active government service with the
“NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION? If I
receive your response on time, this whole transaction
could be accomplished within the shortest possible
time base on your interest and determination,since
the money is already on transit in Central Bank of Nigeria

this transaction,don`t forget to reach me with my e- mail 
address 664l3o2.tvf5m6op579j9 send your phone number accross 
to enable me contact you asap.
