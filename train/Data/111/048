      Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  There is always some madness in love But there is also always some reason in madness You cannot sell the cow and sup the milk There is a time and a place for everything
      But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. In for a penny, in for a pound. Practice makes perfect and Nobody's perfect.

Divide and rule
