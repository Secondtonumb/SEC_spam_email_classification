There is no time like the present 

  As busy as a bee Virtue is its own reward Don't byte off more than you can view.. When the wine is in, the wit is out  From clogs to clogs in only three generations Promises are like babies Easy to make, hard to deliverIf you believe everything you read, you better not read A cat has nine lives. 
  A nod is as good as a wink to a blind man. The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. After dark all cats are leopards To listen is to learn, and to understand is to inspire..And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. Agree, For The Law is Costly Murder will out Hungry nah know bam-by. 
  A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. Youth and Old Age Will Never Agree Life begins at forty Accidents will happen in the best regulated families.But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. A soft answer turneth away wrath. It ain't over 'till it's over. You can only go as far as you push A fool at forty is a fool indeed. You get what you give 
  He Lives Long Who Lives Well As is the gardener, so is the garden Middle age is when broadness of the mind and narrowness of the waist change places  He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing Lightning never strikes twice in the same place Happy is the bride the sun shines on Only mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun  Talk is cheap Ill-gotten gains never prosper A Growing Youth Has a Wolf in His Belly.Take a hair of the dog that bit you The difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  
  Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. The price of greatness is responsibility Look before you leap Robbing Peter to pay Paul A house is not a home.  A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after himThe country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers - japanese proverb Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret. Beware of Greeks bearing gifts  
  Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself Take a hair of the dog that bit you All cassava get same skin but all nah taste same way. Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.Never guh a store ah night fuh buy black cloth. Modulation in all things. When fortune smiles, embrace her Gluttony kills more than the sword  A baby is an alimentary canal with a loud voice at one end and no responsibility at the other. 
  Accidents happen. He knows best what good is that has endured evil  Do right and fear no man Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets. What flares up fast, extinguishes soon Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone The pen is mightier than the sword. Common fame is seldom to blame There are always ears on the other side of the wall  Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it Bread is the staff of life 
  Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people
