      You have to understand, somethings you will never understand  Adversity doesnt build character, it reveals it 
      Fools rush in where angels fear to tread A new broom sweeps clean.
    
    
      The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.Life is like a horse race there are winners and losers

  One man's meat is another man's poison.. Turtle can't walk if he nah push he head outa he shell.Too many clicks spoil the browse. A creaking door hangs longest.
