      When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead. Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man. Watch your thoughts, they become words Watch your words, they become actions, watch your actions, they become habits, watch your habits, they become characer Watch your character, it becomes your destiny  Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise A fool at forty is a fool indeed. An apple a day keeps the doctor at bay
      A picture paints a thousand words. If trousers say massah teef, yuh can't doubt am. You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding.
    
    
      They that dance must pay the fiddlerToo much sit down ah bruck trousers.
      The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. To the victor the spoils  Bread is the staff of life Great minds think alike 
    
  
  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?It is in vain to cast your net where there is no fish  Vex nah gat plaster fuh passion. The West Wind Always Brings Wet Weather, The East Wind Wet and Cold Together, the South Wind Surely Brings Us Rain, the North Wind Blows It Back Again The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit  Turtle nah want trouble mek he walk with he house pon he back. Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain and most fools do Visit your aunt, but not every day of the year A tidy house holds a bored woman. You have to be in it to win it Keep your friends close but your enemies closer Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife
