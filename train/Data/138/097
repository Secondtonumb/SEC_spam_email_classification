      The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth It is a long lane that has no turning All roads lead to Rome Cuss when yuh ah guh, nah wheh yuh ah come out. A fool and his money are soon parted.
      There are two sides to every question Grease is the only cure for a hangover
    
    
      Abstinence makes the heart go wander. And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed.God is Always on the Side of the Big Battalions A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness.
      Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat  A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men. Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. 
    
  
  Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity  Youth is wasted on the young Better late than neverThe looks ah de pudding is not de taste. Poor men seek meat for their stomach; rich men stomach for their meat Its a wise child that knows its own father There Are No Atheists in Foxholes Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. God helps those who help themselves It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount The first step is the hardest A stumble may prevent a fall.
