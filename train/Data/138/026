      All good things must come to an end A sprat to catch a mackerel. Agree, For The Law is Costly
      Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  After a storm comes a calm. Love is the strangest thing
    
     
      Two heads are better than oneSo are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Age is a very high price to pay for maturity
      The best things come in small packages Agree, For The Law is Costly Every step of life is a risk  
    
  
  It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  Great minds think alikeSeldom seen, soon forgotten A black plum is as sweet as a white. Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  Time heals all wounds. Due to the presence of fools, wise people stand out  Do not praise yourself while going into battle; praise yourself coming out of battle
