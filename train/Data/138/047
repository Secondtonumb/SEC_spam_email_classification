      Divide and rule If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried before.
      It takes two to make a quarrel No news is good news Experience is a great servant
    
    
      Cow deh a pasture he nah remember seh dog and butcher deh till he see am. Never judge a book by its cover. All that glisters is not gold Turtle can't walk if he nah push he head outa he shell. The Devil rides upon a fiddlestick He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.
      A fool and his money are soon parted. Doubt is the beginning not the end of wisdom The eyes speak as much as the mouth On the Turf all men are equal, and under it  All good things come to he who waits  In April,a youg mans thoughts turn to fancy! 
    
  
  All things are possible with god Constant dripping wears away the stoneAll is for the best in the best of the possible worlds Boys will be boys Turtle can't walk if he nah push he head outa he shell. Let the buyer beware Never judge a book by its cover. Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat  It takes one to know one All good things must come to an end. A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spirit Bread is the staff of life The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit
