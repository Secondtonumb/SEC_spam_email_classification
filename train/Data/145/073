Gentle mists to kiss thy sight :<user> But it sure can run.How YOU doing?
 
  
 I am freezing to death kissing you. 
 
  
 Hearts never heal, the wounds you inflict are eternal. :  They are fun, and they are sort of complete, but they aren't likely to lurk in our hearts and change our life view. Technically stories they may be, and short they definitely are, but "Short Stories", I argue, they are not. Edgar Allen Poe wrote that the short-story should have a single and unique effect and that every word, every sentence should matter. "If his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole composition there should be no word written of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not toward the one pre-established design."
