      Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. Like the measles, love is most dangerous when it comes late in life Doubt is the beginning of wisdom.
      Always the bridesmaid,never the bride  There is no jollity but hath a smack of folly Imagination is the highest kite you can fly
    
    
      My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance. Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked man ruling over a helpless people It never rains but it pours
      There's no fool like an old fool. as delicate as a baby's eye lashes It is better to wear out than to rust out One good turn deserves another. A squirrel is just a rat with good PR. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 
    
  
  Pain is so close to pleasure And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!Life is beautiful Experience is a wonderful thing It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again  In for a penny, in for a pound None but the wearer knows where the shoe pinches Practice makes perfect and Nobody's perfect. Absence makes the heart go wander. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
