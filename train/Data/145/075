The initial study investigated the microhabitat surrounding squirrel nesting boxes with a prototype habitat suitability tool. In conclusion to this study, it was recognized that a larger area needed to be evaluated as a better representative of the species habitat. In the second phase of this study two habitat suitability indexes were applied to successful habitats and compared. Of the two indexes, the Taylor Index was identified to be utilized in further studies. In the third phase of study, the Taylor Index was applied to successful and unsuccessful translocation sites for data based definition of habitat and further evaluation of the Taylor Index. As the primary and underlying goal of the whole study, defining and assessing optimum habitat of the Delmarva fox squirrel has developed into three applicable phases of research.
