It is foolish to deal with a fool A man in love is a fool, and an old man in love is the greatest fool of all. 

  A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief. Home is where you hang your @. When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead. Least said soonest mended The darkest hour is just before dawnStrangers are just friends you have not met yet 
  If in doubt, mumble As you sow, so shall you reap Never the twain shall meet  The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom The best things in life are freeApril is the cruellest month You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh. Your troubles seem larger the longer you look at them A camel is a horse designed by a committee.  
  Actions speak louder than words. He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing We had nothing to do and we did it very well  A gossips mouth is the devils postbag.Moon ah run till daylight ketch am. Wherever you may be let your wind go free Fish ah deh ah watah but nah ah dam tap. He knows best what good is that has endured evil  A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. Youth and Old Age Will Never Agree 
  Fish and guests smell in three days Two sides of the same coin.We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain  A disposition towards inquiry deprived the feline of its vital state. Never eat an oyster unless there is an R in the month Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way. Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer!It nah good to shove yuh foot in every stocking. 
  A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness. What boots up must come down. Virtual reality is its own reward. A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life. He who flies high is a short step from a big fall  For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. Variety is the spice of lifeA change is as good as a rest. Do not search for a calf under an ox  Like flogging a dead horse He That Brings Good News Knocks Hard 
  Time heals all wounds. Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. All are not cooks that walk with long knivesQuality is better than quantity  All you need is love The pen is mightier than the.. pigs. Experience is a wonderful thing It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again  Folly grows without watering 
  Opportunity seldom knocks twice. A good denial, the best point in law.  The longest day must have an endYouth is wasted on the young All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Never speak ill of the dead  The pen is mightier than the.. pigs. If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick  If anything can go wrong, it will 
  From clogs to clogs in only three generations Know which side your bread is buttered
