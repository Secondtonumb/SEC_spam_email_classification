There is a time and a place for everything Though the wound be healed, a scar remains

      Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled  Familiarity breeds contempt Life is just a bowl of cherries.
      Every dog has his day He who awaits much receives little Things can only get better An old Ox makes a straight furrow
    
    
      Better to aim high and miss, than to aim low and reach target!Cat a ketch rat, but he a teef he massa fish.
      The first step is the hardest. Always the bridesmaid,never the bride  Needs must when the devil drives Ask a silly question and you get a silly answer The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit  Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside  
    
  
  The more you get, the more you wantI pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger  You can lead a horse to water but.. how?. There but for the grace of God go I  When yuh deh in bad luck wet paper self ah cut yuh. Things are not always what they seem. When yuh buy ah dutty calico yuh gat fuh wear am till it tear. Use soft words and hard arguments
