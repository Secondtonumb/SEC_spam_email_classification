heard
whistles and the  shrieks of several  women  audible above the  roar. ' That
means  they have led them  out  on to the  platform,' thought  Pilate, ' and
those  screams are  from  women who  were  crushed  when  the  crowd  surged
forward.'
     He waited for a while, knowing  that  nothing  could silence the  crowd
until it had let loose its pent-up feelings and quietened of its own accord.
     When that moment came tlie Procurator  threw up his  right hand and the
last murmurings  of  the crowd expired. Then Pilate took as deep a breath as
he could of the hot air and his cracked voice rang out over the thousands of
heads :
     'In the name of imperial Caesar! . . .'
     At  once his ears were struck by a  clipped,  metallic  chorus  as  the
cohorts, raising lances and standards, roared out their fearful response:
     'Hail, Caesar! '
     Pilate jerked his head up straight  at the  sun. He had  a sensation of

Hestas, Bar-Abba and Ha-Notsri and there they stand before you! '
     Pilate pointed to  the right, unable to see  the prisoners but  knowing
that they were standing where they should be.
     The crowd responded with a long rumble that could have been surprise or
relief. When it had subsided Pilate went on :
     'But only three of them are to be executed for, in accordance with law
and custom, in honour of the great feast  of Passover the emperor Caesar  in
his magnanimity will,  at the choice  of  the Lesser  Sanhedrin and with the
approval of the Roman government, render back to  one of these convicted men
his contemptible life!'
     As Pilate  rasped out his words he noticed that the rumbling  had given
way to a great  silence. Now  not a sigh, not a rustle reached  his ears and
there even came a moment when it seemed to Pilate that the people around him
