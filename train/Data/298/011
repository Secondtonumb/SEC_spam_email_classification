An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth A good tree brings forth good fruit. 

  True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls  Practice makes perfect. There is no time like the present Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise Beauty without grace is like a hook without bait. . Feed a cold starve a fever A great dowry is a bed full of brambles.  All good things must come to an end Never look a gift horse in the mouthTo understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 
  The pen is mightier than the sword To whom God gives, to him also the people give  Be just before you are generous A leopard cannot change its spots. Love is blind Love thy neighbour as thy selfDishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. Turn the other cheek All that glisters is not gold  Actions speak louder than words. Fools build houses, and wise men live in them 
  The more one knows, the less one believes Coin a phrase Charity covers a multitude of sins A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good. There are two sides to every question The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. Shopping is a therapy  We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  He who hesitates is lost. 
  Life is like a drawing pin - sharp at one end, and flat at the otherMan cannot live on bread alone It ain't over 'till it's over. God gives every bird its food, but does not always drop it into the nest  Quality is better than quantity  Fear lends wingsFlies Come to Feasts Unasked 
  Fax is stranger than fiction. When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern  After dinner rest a while, after supper walk a mile  Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself Accidents will happen in the best regulated families. Love will find a way Every man has his priceA man's reach should exceed his grasp. There Are No Atheists in Foxholes Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. Coin a phrase 
  Genius is an Infinite Capacity for Taking Pains Wedkey dress e pickney till he spoil.	 A man walks, God places the feet.  Opportunity seldom knocks twice.Virtues all agree, but vices fight one another  Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs Lots of people confuse bad management with destiny A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness. Draw Not Your Bow Till the Arrow is Fixed 
  What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive Vex nah gat plaster fuh passion. A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones. A cat has nine lives. He That Will Not Be Counselled Cannot Be Helped A Deaf Husband and a Blind Wife are Always a Happy Couple. If anything can go wrong, it will Beauty without grace is like a hook without bait. . 
  Laughter is the best medicine
