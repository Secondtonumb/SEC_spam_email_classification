made
himself all too conspicuous,  which was probably the  reason why he  had now
changed his tactics  and  withdrawn  to  solitude.  When the procession  had
reached the top of the hill he had been the first of the crowd to appear and
he had shown all the signs of a man arriving late. He had run panting up the
hill,  pushing people aside,  and  when halted by the  cordon he  had made a
naive attempt, by pretending not to understand  their angry shouts, to break
through the line of  soldiers and reach  the  place of execution  where  the
prisoners were  already  being led  off the cart.  For this he  had earned a
savage  blow on the  chest with the blunt end of  a lance  and had staggered
back with  a cry, not of pain but of despair. He had stared at the legionary
who had  hit him  with  the bleary, indifferent look of  a man past  feeling
physical pain.
     Gasping  and clutching his chest he had  run round to the northern side
of the hill, trying to find a gap in the cordon where he might slip through.

carts,  from  which men were  unloading  the gibbet-posts.  Any such attempt
would have led to his arrest and as his  plans  for that day did not include
being arrested, he had hidden himself  in the  crevice  where he could watch
unmolested.
     Now as he sat on his stone, his eyes festering from heat, dust and lack
of sleep, the black-bearded man felt miserable. First he would sigh, opening
his travel-worn tallith, once blue but  now turned dirty grey, and bare  his
sweating,  bruised chest,  then  he  would raise  his  eyes  to the  sky  in
inexpressible agony, following the three vultures who had long been circling
the hilltop in expectation of a feast, then gaze  hopelessly  at  the yellow
soil where he stared at the half-crushed skull of a dog and the lizards that
scurried around it.
     The man  was in  such distress  that now  and  again he  would  talk to
himself.
     'Oh, I am a fool,' he mumbled, rocking back and forth in agony of soul
and scratching his swarthy chest. ' I'm a  fool,  as stupid  as a
