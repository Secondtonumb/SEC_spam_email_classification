not violent, are you? '
     'Yesterday in a  restaurant  I clouted a fellow across the snout,' the
poet confessed manfully.
     'What for? ' asked the visitor disapprovingly.
     'For no reason at all, I must admit,' replied Ivan, embarrassed.
     'Disgraceful,' said the visitor reproachfully and added:
     'And I don't care for that expression of yours--clouted him across the
snout. .  . . People have  faces,  not  snouts. So  I  suppose you mean  you
punched  him  in  the face. . . . No, you  must give up doing that  sort  of
thing.'
     After this reprimand the visitor enquired :
     'What's your job? '
     'I'm a poet,' admitted Ivan with slight unwillingness.
     This annoyed the man.
     'Just my  bad luck!  ' he  exclaimed,  but immediately  regretted it,
apologised and asked : ' What's your name? '
     'Bezdomny.'
     'Oh . . .' said the man frowning.
     'What, don't you like my poetry? ' asked Ivan with curiosity.
     'No, I don't.'
     'Have you read any of it? '
     'I've never read any of your poetry! ' said the visitor tetchily.
     'Then how can you say that? '
     'Why shouldn't I? ' retorted the visitor. ' I've read  plenty of other

poetry.  I don't suppose by some miracle that  yours is any  better, but I'm
ready to take it on trust. Is your poetry good?'
     'Stupendous! ' said Ivan boldly.
     'Don't write any more! ' said the visitor imploringly.
     'I promise not to! ' said Ivan solemnly.
     As they  sealed the  vow with a handshake,  soft footsteps  and  voices
could be heard from the corridor.
     'Sshh! ' whispered  the man.  He bounded  out  on to the  balcony and
closed the grille behind him.
     Praskovya  Fyodorovna looked in, asked Ivan how he felt and  whether he
wanted  to sleep in the dark or the light. Ivan asked her to leave the light
on and Praskovya Fyodorovna departed, wishing him good  night. When  all was
quiet again the visitor returned.
     He told  Ivan in a whisper that a new  patient had been  put  into  No.
119--a fat man  with a purple  face who kept muttering about  dollars in the
ventilation shaft and  swearing  that the  powers of darkness had taken over
their house on Sadovaya. ' He curses Pushkin for all  he's  worth and  keeps

he had grown a little calmer he sat down and said  : ' However, let's
