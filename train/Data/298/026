surged
towards  Jerusalem;  smaller  white  clouds  fled before  the black  monster
charged  with fire and water.  There was a flash and a  thunderclap directly
over the hill. The executioner took the sponge from the lance.
     'Hail to the  merciful  hegemon!  '  he whispered solemnly and gently
pierced Yeshua through the heart. Yeshua shuddered and whispered:
     'Hegemon . . .'
     Blood ran down his stomach, his lower jaw twitched convulsively and his
head dropped. At  the  second thunderclap the executioner gave the sponge to
Dismas with the same words :
     'Hail, hegemon . . .' and killed him.
     Hestas,  his  reason  gone,  cried  out  in  fear  as  the  executioner
approached him, but when the sponge touched his lips he gave a roar and sank
his teeth into it. A few seconds later his body was hanging as limply as the
ropes would allow.
     The man in the hood  followed the executioner and the centurion; behind
him in  turn came  the captain of  the  temple  guard. Stopping at the first
gibbet  the hooded  man  carefully  inspected  Yeshua's  bloodstained  body,
touched the pole with his white hand and said to his companions :

'Dead.'
     The same was repeated at the other two gallows.
     After  this the  Tribune gestured to the  centurion and turned to  walk
down the hill with the captain of the temple guard and the hooded man.
     It was now twilight and lightning was furrowing the black sky. Suddenly
there  was a brilliant  flash and the centurion's  shout of'  Fall out,  the
cordon! '  was  drowned in thunder.  The delighted  soldiers started running
down hill, buckling on their helmets as they went.
     A mist had covered Jerusalem.
     The downpour struck suddenly and caught the centurion  halfway down the
hill. The rain  fell with such force that turbulent streams  began  catching
them up as they ran. The troops slithered and fell on the muddy soil as they
hurried to reach the  main road. Moving fast, now scarcely visible in a veil
of water, the rain-soaked cavalry was already on its  way back to Jerusalem.
After  a  few  minutes  only  one man was left  on  the hill in  the smoking
cauldron of wind, water and fire.
     Brandishing his stolen  knife,  for  which he  now had a use after all,
leaping over  the slippery rocks, grasping whatever  came  to hand, at times
