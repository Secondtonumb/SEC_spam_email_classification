'Ugh, it was a filthy hole! ' he snarled.
     .  . . and rented two rooms  in the basement of  a small house  with  a
garden  near the  Arbat. He gave up his job  in the museum and began writing
his novel about Pontius Pilate.
     'Ah,  that  was  a  golden  age!  '  whispered the narrator,  his eyes
shining. ' A completely self-contained little  flat and a  hall with a  sink
and running water,'  he emphasised proudly, ' little windows just above  the
level of the path leading from the  garden gate. Only a  few steps away,  by
the garden fence, was  a lilac, a lime tree and a maple. Ah, me! In winter I
rarely saw anyone walking  up the garden  path  or heard the crunch of snow.
And there  was always a blaze in my little stove! But suddenly it was spring
and through the muddied  panes of my  windows I saw first  the bare branches
then  the  green  of the  first leaves.  And then,  last  spring,  something
happened  which  was far  more  delightful than  winning a  hundred thousand
roubles. And that, you must agree, is an enormous sum of money! '
     'It is,' Ivan agreed, listening intently.
     'I had opened the  windows and  was sitting in  the second room, which

was quite tiny.' The visitor made measuring gestures. ' Like this--the divan
here, another divan along the other wall, a beautiful lamp on a little table
between them, a bookcase by the window  and over  here  a little bureau. The
main room was huge--fourteen square  metres!--books, more books and a stove.
It was a marvellous little place. How deliciously the lilac used to smell! I
was growing light-headed with fatigue and Pilate was coming to an end .  .'
     'White cloak, red lining! How I know the feeling! ' exclaimed Ivan.
     'Precisely! Pilate was rushing to a conclusion and I already knew what
the last words of the novel would be--"  the fifth Procurator of Judaea, the
knight Pontius Pilate ". Naturally I used to  go  out for  walks. A  hundred
thousand  is a huge  sum and I had a  handsome suit. Or  I would  go out for
lunch to a restaurant. There used to be a wonderful restaurant in the Arbat,
I don't know whether it's still there.'
     Here his eyes opened wide and as he whispered he gazed at the moon.
     'She was carrying some of those repulsive yellow  flowers.  God knows
what they're called, but  they are somehow always the first  to  come out in
