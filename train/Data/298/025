first at the shuttered window.
     There was a loud crash, but the glass  did not even crack, and a moment
later  Ivan Nikolayich  was  struggling  in  the arms  of  the orderlies. He
screamed, tried to bite, then shouted :
     'Fine sort of glass you put in your windows! Let me go! Let me go! '
     A hypodermic syringe glittered in the doctor's hand, with one sweep the
woman pushed back the tattered sleeve of  Ivan's blouse  and clamped his arm
in a most  un-feminine  grip.  There  was a  smell of ether,  Ivan  weakened
slightly  in the grasp of the  four men and the  doctor skilfully seized the
moment to  jab the  needle into Ivan's arm. Ivan kept up  the struggle for a
few more seconds, then collapsed on to the divan.
     'Bandits! ' cried Ivan and leaped up, only to be  pushed back. As soon
as they  let him go he jumped up again, but sat down of  his  own accord. He
said nothing, staring  wildly about him, then gave a sudden  unexpected yawn

you'll pay for it ... I warned you, but if you want to ... What interests me
most now is Pontius Pilate . . .  Pilate . .  .' And with that he closed his
eyes.
     'Vanna, put him in No. 117 by himself and with someone to watch him.'
The doctor gave his  instructions and replaced his spectacles. Then  Ryukhin
shuddered again : a pair of white  doors  opened without a sound  and beyond
them stretched  a  corridor lit  by  a row of  blue night-bulbs. Out  of the
corridor rolled a couch on rubber wheels. The sleeping Ivan was lifted on to
it, he was pushed off down the corridor and the doors closed after him.
     'Doctor,' asked the shaken Ryukhin in a whisper, ' is he really ill?'
     'Oh yes,' replied the doctor.
     'Then what's the matter with him?' enquired Rvukhin timidly.
     The exhausted doctor looked at Ryukhin and answered wearily:
