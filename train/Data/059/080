Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the 0pp0rtunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant F A L C O N  E N E R G Y  I N C. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

If you miss F.C.Y.I now you WILL regret it.

Watered down. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Tossed around like a hot potato.   Putting it in a nutshell.   Your name is mud.  Timing is everything.  Say it with flowers.   Walking on water. A place in the sun.   The sharper is the berry, the sweeter is the wine. Shake like a leaf. Your all washed up. Sow dry and set wet. Welcome to my garden.  Ugly as a mud fence. Raking in the dough. You feel like a fish out of water. Spring to mind.   Putting the cart before the horse. As uneasy as a cat near water.   The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  Stand your ground. Walking on water.

Survival of the fittest.   Stop and smell the roses. Save it for a rainy day.   Spaceship earth.   Worked night and day. Weed it out.  That's a whole new can of worms.   Sly as a fox.   Sly as a fox.   The scythe ran into a stone. Putting it in a nutshell.   Where man is not nature is barren. Schools out for summer.   Turn over a new leaf. Put off the scent.
