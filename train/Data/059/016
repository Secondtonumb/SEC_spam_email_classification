Dear International Trader,

You have been selected to participate in the Global Business Confidence Index Survey. The survey is designed to measure the business confidence of U.S exporters as well as importers of products and services from the United States.

This is an opportunity to share your opinion about issues and trends related to international business. Your feedback will be used to develop and maintain a leading economic index that will be updated six times each year. The results will provide insight into market trends and global economic conditions.

You can submit the survey anonymously. But if you provide your contact information at the end of the survey, we will e-mail you the results of the survey, and you will have a chance to win a free Palm Z22 handheld device.

THE SURVEY TAKES ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO COMPLETE.
