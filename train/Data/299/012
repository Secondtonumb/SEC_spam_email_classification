ethod for temporary sealing of crack formation on aluminium ship 
- Project no. 965984

Project description
A Danish enterprise working with repairs on big ships, wants to establish cooperation with enterprise or knowledge center, which can suggest or develop a method to temporarily seal against water penetration (100%) on the outside of the ship and below water, when crack formation occur on an aluminium ship.

It often occurs that the enterprise has to stop water penetration in crack formation on aluminium ships by welding a plate to the inside of the hull where the crack formation is. In order to do this it is necessary, during the welding process, to stop the water penetration completely by sealing the outside of the hull effectively around or at the spot of the water penetration.

The cracks typically have a length of app. 25 cm, and they are so thin that, at depths up to 25 m below the water line, water penetrates on the inside in the form of a "jet".

The crack formation may appear on clean flat surfaces, on curved surfaces, on edges, and on "protrusions" on the hull.

The hull is made of aluminium with material thicknesses of app. 8-15 mm. To create a completely "plane" surface the hull has been filled with filler (Belsone), which may be several millimetres thick.

The enterprise has attempted several sealing methods, but none has proved fully satisfactory. Among other things attempts with a one-component polyurethane product - Tacss 020NF (see syl.p4btnftrzxtr071.49) have been made with some degree of success without fully solving the problem, however.

The method/remedy shall
-	provide 100% sealing for minimum 120 minutes
-	be applicable/mountable by 1-2 professional divers (1 diver will be absolutely preferable)
-	preferably not create a vacuum on the outside of the crack itself, because this will render the argon welding on the inside difficult
-	if possible, also be applicable on ship hulls made of steel.
