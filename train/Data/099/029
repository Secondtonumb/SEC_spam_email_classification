Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the 0pp0rtunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!


-----------------------
Tossed around like a hot potato.   There is always next year.   Spill the beans.   What goes up must come down. We hung them out to dry.  Two peas in a pod.  Too little too late.   A place in the sun.   Spill the beans.   A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Water it down.  The silly season.   The scythe ran into a stone. Weed it out.  Tall as a tree.   Rain, rain go away; come again some other day. A tree does not move unless there is wind.   When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Sitting on the fence. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   Timing is everything.  To gild refined gold, to paint the lily. Shit happens.   Timing is everything. 

A rolling stone gathers no moss. Walking on thin ice. We hung them out to dry.  Sow much, reap much; sow little, reap little. Stubborn as a mule.   The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees. Stone cold sober.   Speak softly and carry a big stick.   Still water runs dirty and deep.   Ugly as a mud fence. This is for the birds.   A thorn in my side.   Put to bed with a shovel. A tree does not move unless there is wind.   There is always next year.   Your in hot water.
