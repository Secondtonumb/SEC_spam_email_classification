      It is a long lane that has no turning The longest day must have an end He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others
      For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. All things come to those who wait If cow-man pass wild meat whah mek me must pick up am. Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred 
    
    
      A good conscience is the best divinity.To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world  Golden dishes will never turn black 
      Keep your mouth shut and your ears open. Every picture tells a story It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  He who plays with fire will get burnt You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds 
    
  
  In the coldest flint there is hot fire Lightning never strikes twice in the same placeGood broth may be made in an old pot Practice what you preach  Yuh can't fatten cow fuh another man butcher.	 When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings Confession is good for the soul
