      Never be afraid to sit awhile and think  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Your future lies before you like a field of driven snow Be careful how you tread it for every step will show Belly full behind drunk.
      Never speak ill of the dead  Nothing is certain but death and taxes Fine words butter no parsnips  None so deaf as those who will not hear 
    
    
      It never rains but it pours Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer!A miss is as good as a mr. Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you

  Like the measles, love is most dangerous when it comes late in lifeGood broth may be made in an old pot Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger.

He who plays with fire will get burnt Happiness is wanting what you have - not having what you want Goodness is better than beauty
