Take time to smell the 3a662.pk8v as a green apple.  Stone cold sober.  Weed 'um and d0n7.5g15 pigs fly. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.  Putting it in a nutshell.  The scum of the earth.  Sly as a fox.  Rare as walking on water. Through the grapevine.  Through the grapevine.  She has a green 4v372.5g15 pigs fly.
