Too many clicks spoil the browse  A man is known by the company he keeps.

      It takes two to tango A journey of a thousand sites begins with a single click. A camel is a horse designed by a committee. 
      You have to be in it to win it Better wed over the mixen than over the moor
    
    
      What we see depends mainly on what we look for  Speak softly and carry a cellular phone.A man is judged by his deeds, not by his words.
      The truth will out When man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am. Lend your money and lose your friend And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. 
    
  
  The stick is the surest peacemaker A watched pot never boils.There is no such thing as a free lunch Knowing is not enough; We must Apply Willing is not enough; We must Do Every dog has his day There is no physician like a true friend  It never rains, but it pours. If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport. He who awaits much receives little A bad excuse is better than none.
