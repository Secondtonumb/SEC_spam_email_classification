Flies never visit an egg that has no crack  A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. 

  Ill-gotten gains never prosper A Good Tongue is a Good Weapon. If you lie down with the dogs, you'll.. stink in the morning. A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor. Plant the crab tree where you will, it will never bear pippins  One mans loss is another mans gainPeople living in glass houses should not!. 
  Rats desert a sinking ship In for a penny, in for a pound. Nah because dog ah play with yuh he nah bite yuh. Curiosity killed the cat. Don't mind how bird vex, it can't vex with tree. Misery loves company Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger.So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination He Is Rich Enough That Wants Nothing Never be afraid to sit awhile and think  
  It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  You cannot sell the cow and sup the milk Keep your friends close but your enemies closer Laughter is the best medicine. He That Teaches Himself has a Fool for his Master When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead.He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin If in doubt, mumble The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination There is a skeleton in every cupboard  There is no physician like a true friend  
  Nah mind how pumpkin vine run, he must dry up one day.A fool will laugh when he is drowning. If the wind will not serve, take to the oars One of these days is none of these days. If you are planning for a year - sow rice, if you are planning for a decade - sow trees, if you are planning for a lifetime - educate people Half a loaf is better than none. All the world loves a lover Nah all who guh a church house ah guh fuh pray.A whistling women and a crowing hen are neither fit for God or men. 
  A picture paints a thousand words. There is an exception to every rule If yuh eye nah see, yuh mouth nah must talk. It takes one to know one If you wish to be loved, love A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.He who is ABSENT is always in the Wrong A fly will not get into a closed mouth. Your troubles seem larger the longer you look at them 
  The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed Goodness is better than beauty When man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am.You cannot get to the top by sitting on your bottom An idle mind is.. the best way to relax. His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 
  Eat well, stay fit, die anyway.  You have to understand, somethings you will never understand  Cheats never prosperHe who sups with the devil should have a long spoon A crowd is not company.  Love is like a fire, it can either warm your heart or burn your house down A stitch in time saves nine. We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  as wrinkled as an elephant's hide Faith will move mountains. 
  Rats desert a sinking ship.
