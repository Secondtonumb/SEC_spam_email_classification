When two big bottle deh ah table lil one nah business deh. A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. 

  One years seeding means seven years weeding Age has no friend but the wrinkles of the mind One good turn deserves another. Tomorrow never comes Everyday is a fresh slate One kiss nah done lips. Nothing is interesting if you are not interested  They Brag Most That Can Do the LeastNah every crab hole get crab.	 Better one house spoiled than two 
  Great starts make great finishes. Chaste makes waste. A worry shared is a worry halved. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. The last straw breaks the camel's back.From the sweetest wine the tartest vinegar Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble  Finders keepers, losers weepers Murder will out These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. 
  A tree never hits an automobile except in self defense. He Who Keeps Company with the Wolf Will Learn How to Howl I had no shoes and complained, until I met a man who had no feet  Fine words butter no parsnips  He is an ill companion that has a good memory An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  A spy with flatulence will always blow his cover. Where the carcass is, there shall the eagles be gathered together  Desperate Diseases Call for Desperate Remedies 
  The first faults are theirs that commit them, the second theirs that permit them Too many chiefs and not enough indiansThe darkest hour is just before dawn He is at Ease Who Has Enough Fear lends wings Saying is one thing; doing another  Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled  Like music to my ears Beauty is in the eye of the beholder Look before you leapWhen man done suck cane he dash peeling pan ground. 
  Nothing is interesting if you are not interested  Be kind to people on the way up, you may need them when you are on your way down There's a light at the end of the tunnel. One good turn deserves half the blankets Walls have ears  No one is expected to achieve the impossibleZeal without knowledge, is fire without light To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow 
  And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious. It nah good to shove yuh foot in every stocking.If the cap fits, wear it Rained on ground hardens (Japanese Proverb) He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son  as wrinkled as an elephant's hide 
  There is a skeleton in every cupboard  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse. Things are not always what they seem. Time and tide wait for no man.There is a skeleton in every cupboard  No good carpenter does get good wuk bench. It nah good to shove yuh foot in every stocking. A good lawyer must be a great liar. Bread is the staff of life Use soft words and hard arguments Attack is the best form of defence The early worm enjoys a leisurely breakfast  
  Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf.
