Hi,

Developers worldwide are embracing xPML, a new scripting language designed
to extend applications from web into mobile media. Join these early-adopters
and attend a live 30-minute coding event hosted by the Senior xPML
Architect, Andrew Ballester.

Explore the xPML sample code and see how you can take your applications to
the handsets of nearly 1.5 billion users in over 180 countries through a
User API, Mobile API, and Billing API.

		xPML Web Seminar
		Wednesday, April 12, 2006
		10:00 AM PST (18:00 GMT)

The xPML SDK, sample code, and an archive of the presentation will also be
available to all registrants after the event.
