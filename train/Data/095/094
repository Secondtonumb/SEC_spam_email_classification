      Happiness is wanting what you have - not having what you want Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. Fine words butter no parsnips  Cow deh a pasture he nah remember seh dog and butcher deh till he see am.
      You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft A stumble may prevent a fall. After dinner rest a while, after supper walk a mile  For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life. One volunteer is worth ten pressed men
    
    
      Business before pleasureLove is blind. A black plum is as sweet as a white.
      Love is blind. Share and share alike! Hasty climbers have sudden falls As you sow, so shall you reap Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. 
    
  
  A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight. Fools seldom differ.Facts are stubborn things Robbing Peter to pay Paul It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick  Good fences make good neighbours! The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory  The difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. From the sweetest wine the tartest vinegar At the end of the game, the King and the pawn go back in the same box Absence makes the heart go wander. The price of greatness is responsibility Virtual reality is its own reward.
