      Civility costs nothing Have you ever noticed? anybody going slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac

      To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding. Revenge is a dish best served cold.Fruit out of season, sorrow out of reason You can't teach an old dog new.. math.
      After all is said and done, more is said than done  A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  In vino veritas  Beware of Greeks bearing gifts  Tailors and writers must mind the fashion For every action, there is an equal and opposite government program.  
    
  
  Dont make love at the garden gate, love is blind but the neighbours aint A slip of the tongue is no fault of the mind and he who laughs is very unkind.To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day.
