Good day to you. I am Mr. Remond R. johnson, an Accounts Clerk
with one of the major banks in Spain. I came 
across your email address during a thorough search for a 
reliable and trustworthy person who can assist me carry-out 
a mutual and benefiting transaction in my bank.
Only recently I discovered that an account belonging to a
customer name Mr. Richard Pius Nault has remained dormant 
for the past two years, after intensive investigations, I found
out that Mr. Richard Pius Nault died in a gastly auto accident
in June, 2002.
At this point I am contacting you concerning a business
acquaintance that necessitates you to act as a new beneficiary
as a next of kin to the said dormant account as I hope to give
you more technical details on how we can transfer the funds
into your nominated offshore/residence account. Please if you

full names, address (home/office), phone and fax numbers to
enable me give you full details of our plans to success.
