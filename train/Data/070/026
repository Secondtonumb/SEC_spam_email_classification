[RE: TRANSFER OF $ 36,000,000]
 
                        [THIRTY SIX MILLION US
                         

                        Dear!Sir,

y name 
is Mr. Edmond  Ken , and I work in theInternational operation 
department in a Local Bank here in South Africa. On a routine 
inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a 2k8.68 
36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, 
I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away 
(dead)leaving no beneficiary to the account.

The bank will approve 
this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a 
foreigner and from Iraq in particular and I am
certainly sure that he 
is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A 
foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account  
Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.I will 
provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, 
But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred.
 
If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax
number including 
full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for 
utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the 
future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.

I want 
to assure you that the transaction is withoutrisk if due process is 
followed accordingly.

Finally,I will give you 32% for your 
corporation.
I look forward to a favorable response from you.
Yours
r. 
Edmond  Ken
