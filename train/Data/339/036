"But I Can't" 
                         Amy Billings 


I'd like to be able to say that I've forgiven you...
But I can't.

I'd like to be able to say that I still love you...
But I can't. 

I'd like to hold you in my arms and know that you were mine alone...
But I can't.

I'd like to think you're dreaming of me when you reach out at night...
But I can't.

I'd like to believe that you love me and only want to be with me...
But I can't.

I'd like to hear you say that you'll never let me go...
But I can't.

I'd really like not to feel like this or want you to be mine...
But I do.
