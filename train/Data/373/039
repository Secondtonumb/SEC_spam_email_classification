      Talk about things of tomorrow and the mice inside the ceiling laugh A man's home is his castle. The rotten apple injures its neighbours Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious. When water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. A great dowry is a bed full of brambles. 
      One foolish sheep will lead the flock All roads lead to Rome The Gods Send Nuts to those who have no Teeth
    
    
      Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree When good cheer is lacking, our friends will be packingA house is not a home.  Exigency is the matriarch of ingenious contrivance. Quickly come, quickly go
      God helps those who help themselves Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. Bitter pills may have blessed effects Every step of life is a risk  Motivation is what gets you started habit is what keeps you going  He who does not honour his wife dishonours himself 
    
  
  Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightlyApril is the cruellest month Fish and guests smell in three days Its a wise child that knows its own father Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly Look after number one For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. Only mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun  Many a true word is spoken in jest If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried before. Jack of all trades, master of none Dog buy rum, cow drink am, hog in sty get drunk.
