Dear Beloved.
  After due deliberation and consideration I decided to forward you this details as regards to the proposal. Like I earlier said I am the chairman of the Ivory Coast cocoa corporation, I want you to assist me in the claim of the sum of seven million, six hundred thousand united state dollars (USD$7.6M) that is packaged in a trunk box and was made deposited under the custody of a storage company on behalf of a foreign partner.
  This fund was as a result of an over invoiced cocoa supplied out by us under the budget allocation to my ministry, the bill was approved and paid by the concerned ministry. We are left with the balance of USD$7.6M as the over invoice amount which I have deliberately over estimated for my own use but under the protocol division civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts and couple with the recent sanctions by the united nation (U.N) and Organization of African unity (O.A.U) on dealings of huge amount of fund and firing Arms due to the political crisis in Ivory Coast, that is why the fund was packaged inside trunk box and was made deposited to a storage company on behalf of a foreign partner as his family valuables.
   I have now decided to contact you for assistance towards putting up a claim to the storage company for the transfer of the box to you in your country. I have also agreed to share the fund as follows:
  1. 30% for your Endeavourment
  2. 60% for me
  3. 10% for tax as may be required by your government.
  This deal is very much free from all sort of risk hence the deal was carefully planned before it was executed Upon indication of your interest to fully assist me in this transaction shall i furnish you with every vital document and information?s that will enable you put up a claim to the storage company. I will send down one of my representative to your country before the arrival of the box. You are advised not to go through international operator due to the confidentiality and sensitivity involved in the deal and hence i am still on active service.
   Let honesty and trust be our watchword through out this transaction.
   I wish your humble co-operation will be highly solicited.
  Awaiting your soonest and positive responses. Reply with this 
  Following. E-Mail ADDRESS: 344513rmph55djo31@yahoo.co.i5
  Tour?s Truly,
  Mr. Durck Saga Kouassi
