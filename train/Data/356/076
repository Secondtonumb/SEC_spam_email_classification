      A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. There is no difference between a wise man and a fool when they fall in love The higher the monkey climbs, the more he shows his tail It will all come right in the wash Two fools in a house are too many An English Summer, Three Hot Days and a Wednderstorm
      The squeaky wheel gets the grease. The West Wind Always Brings Wet Weather, The East Wind Wet and Cold Together, the South Wind Surely Brings Us Rain, the North Wind Blows It Back Again
    
    
      We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain  Strike while the iron is hot Lil finger point to de big thumb and sey nah guh.For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. In for a penny, in for a pound Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
      Fish ah play ah sea, he nah know watah ah boil fuh am. A gentleman without an estate is a pudding without suet.  When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise A man's reach should exceed his grasp. 
    
  
  A house is not a home.  The pen is mightier than the sword. If there were no lossers there could be no winners Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer! Zeal without knowledge, is fire without light Every picture tells a story None but the brave deserve the fair  Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down A miss is as good as a mile. Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it A sly rabbit will have three openings to its den. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded.
