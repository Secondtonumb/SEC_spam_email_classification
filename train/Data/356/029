Business Description: VISION ENERGY GROUP (Other OTC: 5q3g.67 - News) Vision Energy Group, Inc., a development stage company, owns a technology to generate clean power from pressure letdown at the let down control valves in high pressure natural gas transmission lines. This let down recovery system utilizes a waste heat source in combination with let down expansion turbine. The company was founded in 2002 and is based in Marina Del Rey, California.

Overview:

Thousands of small, inexpensive, scattered and environmentally-friendly sources of energy can now be harvested profitably by using Vision Energy.s (VEG) proven cryogenic and pressure let down technologies to capture otherwise wasted sources of power. Our mini-plants are geared either to electrical generation from natural gas pipeline pressures or the manufacture of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from landfill emissions or "stranded" natural gas sources. In both cases sites are close to attractive markets and offer energy at sharply reduced rates. Capital investment for reliable energy can be reduced by more than ten-fold by a mini-plant while also lowering operating costs.


Technology Opportunity:

Since the deregulation of the energy sector the industry has been changed in many ways. Vision Energy has the opportunity to capitalize on the two major expenses which the industry is saddled with, the expense of the extensive power grid (distributing the power) and the inefficiencies in the outdated technology in use. The technologies the industry has employed are outdated and put into service at a time which is very different from the deregulated industry of today.

Vision Energy plans to focus on major gas consumers/electricity producers, who have much to gain from utilizing our technologies and solutions. Our solutions offer on-site production or supplementation of power therefore eliminating the extra cost of transporting the j8ye50t4th9.d84 improvements in technology used to capture extra energy will have a direct relationship to the cost, availability, and the environmental impact of the industry.


WATCH THIS S T O C K GO HIGHER AND HIGHER



-----------------------
You never miss the water till the well runs dry. She's a mother hen.   Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  There's no time like the present.   Your in hot water. Wrinkled as a prune. Timber! Still waters run deep. Play a harp before a cow. This is for the birds.   Your name is mud.  The season of goodwill.   Water under the bridge. Root it out. Put off the scent.   A snail's pace. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. To gild refined gold, to paint the lily. A thorn in my side.   As uneasy as a cat near water.   Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. Where man is not nature is barren.

She's a nut.   Stuck in a rut.  They're like two peas in a pod.  You have to separate the chaff from the wheat. Your name is mud.  Spring to mind.   Take time to smell the roses. Schools out for summer.   When we love - we grow.  Welcome to my garden.  Rain, rain go away; come again some other day. What on earth? Read the tea leaves. Weed it out.
