a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to
gnaw, but he wanted something softer.
Quite safe, yes, he whispered to himself. It wont see us, will
it, my precious? No. It wont see us, and its nassty little sword will
be useless, yes quite.
That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly
from Bilbos side, and flapped back to his boat, and went off into the
dark. Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. Still he waited a
while; for he had no idea how to find his way out alone.
Suddenly he heard a screech. It sent a shiver down his back. Gollum
was cursing and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound
of it. He was on his island, scrabbling here and there, searching and
seeking in vain. Where is it? Where iss it? Bilbo heard him crying.
