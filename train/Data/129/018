      As you sow, so shall you reap If you educate a man you educate an individual but if you educate a woman you educate a family 
      Two fools in a house are too many Strike while the.. bug is close. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill! After the storm comes the calm
    
    
      Strike while the iron is hot The world is full of willing people: some willing to work and some willing to let them He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog.
      A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness. He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others Lucky at cards, unlucky in love God helps those who help themselves Two wrongs do not make a right Your troubles seem larger the longer you look at them When the student is ready, the master will appear  Be first at the feast, and last at the fight 
    
  
  He who hesitates is lost.Anybody can make history Only a great man can write it  The higher the tree, the sweeter the plum  Every Soldier has the Baton of a Field Marshal in his Knapsack Discretion is the better part of valour You cannot get to the top by sitting on your bottom The pen is mightier than the sword. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched . Death pays all debts Fools and madmen speak the truth
