sma RIE. This results in the cross section
described in Figure 3.37(b). The next-to-last step is the release of the beam.
This is accomplished by immersing the wafer in a solution of hydrofluoric
acid, which preferentially etches the sacrificial oxide layer over the polysilicon
structural layer. The wafer thus released is then cleaned to remove any
remaining etch residues from the beam-to-electrode gap. This involves
immersion in a cleaning solution of H2SO4 and H2O2 (called piranha etch)
for 25 minutes, as well as a supercritical CO2 clean.

e, the classification error rate was 0.8% for the consonants /b,d,g/, 00% for the vowels
/a,i,u/, and 0.8% for the word pair ¡°rapid/rabid¡±.
Robinson and Fallside (1988) applied another kind of recurrent network, first proposed by
Jordan (1986), to phoneme classification. In this network, output activations are copied to a
¡°context¡± layer, which is then fed back like additional inputs to the hidden layer (as shown
in Figure 3.9). The network was trained using ¡°back propagation through time¡±, an algorithm
first suggested by Rumelhart et al (1986), which unfolds or replicates the network at
each moment of time. Their recurrent network outperformed a feedforward network with

comparable delays, achieving 22.7% versus 26.0% error for speaker-dependent recognition,
and 30.8% versus 40.8% error for multi-speaker recognition. Training time was reduced to
a reasonable level by using a 64-processor array of transputers.
