Don't byte off more than you can view.. A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  After dark all cats are leopards

      Life is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved Wise men think alike. One who has the reputation of an early riser may safely lie in bed until noon  Football is a game of two halves
      An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  Actions speak louder than words. Hasty climbers have sudden falls Like the measles, love is most dangerous when it comes late in life A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. He who wants to do good, knocks at the gate, he who loves finds the gates open
    
    
      A miss is as good as a mr. Ill-gotten gains never prosperKill two birds with one stone Wise children have short years Don't mind how bird vex, it can't vex with tree.
      He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian Happy is the bride the sun shines on We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  See Naples and die The e-mail of the species is more deadly than the mail. Fools seldom differ  Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. 
    
  
  In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is King No man is a hero to his valetA closed mouth gathers no feet.  Speed thrills. Nothing seems expensive on credit Happiness is not a state of mind, but a manner of travelling  Two things a man should never be angry at: what he can help and what he cannot help  Never stand on the tail of a hedgehog after midnight Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. No matter how long a log stays in the water it does not become a crocodile  You can lead a horse to water but.. how?. A child is a person who can dismantle in 25 minutes the toy it took you 25 hours to put together.
