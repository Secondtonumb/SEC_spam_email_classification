      A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  Lightning never strikes twice in the same place. The higher the monkey climbs, the more he shows his tail Forgive and forget
      More haste less speed He who is ABSENT is always in the Wrong Lucky at cards, unlucky in love Give and spend and God will send A man is known by the company he keeps.  Its only rock n roll but I like it
    
    
      The King can make a knight, but not a gentleman  Take your time and time will take you  Actions speak louder than words.It's always darkest before.. daylight savings time.
      In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is King When children stand still they have done some ill No man is an island Everything must have a beginning Be a good sport - wherever you go  All the world loves a lover A fair exchange is no robbery. 
    
  
  But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.Faint heart never won fair lady He Lives Long Who Lives Well Only time will tell Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way. Shame face ah feel like cent ice. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. A friend is not so soon gotten as lost. Little things please little minds A miss is as good as a mile. Greedy folks have long arms
