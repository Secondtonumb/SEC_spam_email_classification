One man's meat is another man's poison.. 

  Look after number one Cold hands, warm heart  He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son  Death pays all debts A stitch in time saves nine. A penny saved is.. not much. Without rice, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook  Murder will out It's always darkest before.. daylight savings time.It will all come right in the wash 
  Borrowed Garments Never Fit Well He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill! Like father, like son as dry as chapped lips The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it When dog hungry he ah nyam calabash.There is illumination at the termination of the subterranean excavation. Cuss when yuh ah guh, nah wheh yuh ah come out. A man walks, God places the feet.  Haste makes waste. 
  One beats the bush, another takes the bird Needs must when the devil drives Once in a blue moonA Deaf Husband and a Blind Wife are Always a Happy Couple. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence Once in a while, right in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives us a fairy tale A miss is as good as a.. Mr.. 
  What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceiveA good man is hard to find. In April,a youg mans thoughts turn to fancy! A faithful friend is a medicine for life. After the storm comes the calm A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spirit All cassava get same skin but all nah taste same way. The best doctors are Dr Diet, Dr Quiet and Dr MerrymanThink before you speak Everything comes to him who waits 
  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission  The stylus is more potent than the claymore. No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness  Home is where you hang your @. Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow  Idle people lack no excuses  Think Much, Speak Little and Write LessThe pot calls the kettle black. Water that has been begged for does not quench the thirst 
  Dead men tell no tales Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you Lil ah sick, big a get better. Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred  Too many cooks spoil the brothNo man is an island What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts If you lie down with dogs you will come up with fleas  We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  You can't teach a new mouse old clicks. 
  Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred  If you educate a man you educate an individual but if you educate a woman you educate a family  To have is to hold and to hold is to haveThe proof of the pudding is in the eating Give Neither Counsel Nor Salt till You Are Asked For It The company makes the feast To deceive oneself is very easy Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. When the wine is in, the wit is out  As you make your bed, so must you lie in it A miss is as good as a mr. 
  Revenge is sweet Trust is the mother of deceit
