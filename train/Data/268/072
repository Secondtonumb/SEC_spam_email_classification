      If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried before. Hard work never did anyone any harm  No pain, no gain  If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava.
      A danger foreseen is half avoided. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery Keep your chin up
    
    
      If there were no lossers there could be no winners A man walks, God places the feet.  Coin a phrase Actions speak louder than words.
      Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. Life is not all beer and skittles He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son  A tidy house holds a bored woman. Every little helps 
    
  
  You cant buy love  God made the country and man made the town!Laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone Half a loaf is better than none. Practice makes perfect Many are called but few are chosen A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  Better to be alone than in bad company  as dry as chapped lips as dry as chapped lips
