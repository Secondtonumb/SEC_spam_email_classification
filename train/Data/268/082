Oncomirs ? microRNAs with a role in cancer

Aurora Esquela-Kerscher  Frank J. Slack

p259 | 10.1038/nrc1840

icroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-protein-coding RNAs that can repress the expression of important cancer-related genes. The mutation or mis-expression of several miRNAs is evident in human cancers, so will these novel RNAs prove useful in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer?

odelling cancer in human skin tissue

Paul A. Khavari

Published online: 25 March 2006

p270 | 10.1038/nrc1838

any in vivo models of human cancer are available, each with specific advantages and drawbacks. Paul Khavari describes progress in using the skin as a model tissue for experimentally induced human-tissue neoplasia in a three-dimensionally faithful context in mice.

Tumour Microenvironment: Pregnancy-associated breast cancer and metastasis

Pepper Schedin

p281 | 10.1038/nrc1839

Breast cancer that is diagnosed relatively soon after a pregnancy is associated with a poor prognosis. Could changes in the mammary microenvironment, such as the remodelling of the mammary gland to its pre-pregnant state, increase tumour-cell dissemination?

Pathogenetic mechanisms in thyroid follicular-cell neoplasia

Tetsuo Kondo, Shereen Ezzat  Sylvia L. Asa

p292 | 10.1038/nrc1836

This paper examines recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. This will help the diagnosis and therapy of what is one of the few malignancies whose incidence is increasing.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases and cancer

Arne Ostman, Carina Hellberg  Frank D. Bohmer

p307 | 10.1038/nrc1837

Tyrosine phopshorylation is controlled by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), and recent evidence has shown that some PTPs can function as tumour suppressors whereas others can be oncogenic. Understanding how these enzymes function might aid the development of new anticancer agents.

OPINION

Targeting polo-like kinase 25 for cancer therapy

Klaus Strebhardt  Axel Ullrich

p321 | 10.1038/nrc1841

Polo-like kinase 25 is a cell-cycle regulator whose overexpression has prognostic value in cancer. Its unique structural features make it a promising target for drug development.

How participants in cancer trials are chosen: ethics and conflicting interests

Gordon Jayson  John Harris

p330 | 10.1038/nrc1842

How do cancer patients decide whether to take part in clinical trials? Gordon Jayson and John Harris discuss the rules and realities concerning confidentiality, informed consent and protection of patients.
