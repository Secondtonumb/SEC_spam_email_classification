      It's always darkest before.. daylight savings time. When good cheer is lacking, our friends will be packing Borrowed Garments Never Fit Well A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. All roads lead to Rome
      God is Always on the Side of the Big Battalions Every rope gat two ends. Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from a friends forehead Life is just a bowl of cherries Life begins at forty The bigger they are, the harder they fall 
    
    
      Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly Walk before you can run Pentium wise; pen and paper foolish.Let sleeping dogs lie
      A guilty conscience needs no accuser.  It is a long lane that has no turning A tidy house holds a bored woman. Wedendship is like money,easier made than kept A bad penny always turns up. Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious. Gluttony kills more than the sword  Every Cook Praises His Own Broth 
    
  
  Those who play the game do not see it as clearly as those who watch Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors I had no shoes and complained, until I met a man who had no feet A bad penny always turns up. As you make your bed, so must you lie in it Wedendship is like money,easier made than kept Time and tide wait for no man Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit  If cow-man pass wild meat whah mek me must pick up am. Well done is better than well said A cat may look at a Queen. When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission
