      Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. Nothing seems expensive on credit If a son is uneducated, his dad is to blame Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow 
      Hope springs eternal  A creaking door hangs longest. No good carpenter does get good wuk bench.
    
    
      Every bush a man night time.Some are Wise and Some are Otherwise To listen is to learn, and to understand is to inspire..
      Cultivate money and you grow rich, Cultivate mind and you raise culture Fight truth decay, read the bible  A nod is as good as a wink to a blind man. When It Rains and the Wed Shines at the Same Time the Devil is Beating his Wife 
    
  
  Age has no friend but the wrinkles of the mind He who is ABSENT is always in the WrongTo know the road ahead, ask those coming back Nothing is interesting if you are not interested  A great dowry is a bed full of brambles.

To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow
