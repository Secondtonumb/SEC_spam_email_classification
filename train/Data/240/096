Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi . PK - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and 1www02yr4mz8.e80rh1 Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

-----------------------
When we love - we grow.  Survival of the fittest.   Watch and wait.  Walking on water. Timing is everything.  Play a harp before a cow. Strong as an ox.  Raking in the dough. Slow as a snail.   Put off the scent.   Slow as a snail.   The scythe ran into a stone. A snail's pace. The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  A thorn in my side.   Watered down. Tall as a tree.  

You feel like a fish out of water. What goes up must come down. Slow as a snail.   Rare as walking on water.  Play a harp before a cow. Stand your ground. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.  Water under the bridge. Slow as molasses in January. Sweating blood.   A tree does not move unless there is wind.   We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  When it rains it pours.   Spaceship earth.   Run to seed.  Through the grapevine.   A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Stubborn as a mule.   Up one side and down the other.   Wrinkled as a prune. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Stir up an ant's nest.
