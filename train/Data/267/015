Red H0t News:

H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e Expands the Creative Palette for Independent Filmmakers GLENDALE, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--May 31, 2006 -- H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e, Inc. A provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced today that its Matchframe Digital Intermediate division is currently providing full digital intermediate services for Super 16MM productions.

H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e, Inc. (H Y W I . P K - News), a provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced that High Definition preview masters as part of its normal digital intermediate service offerings and workflow.

"Typically, in current post-production workflow, HD dailies masters are edited into high quality preview masters including color timing, dirt removal, opticals and visual effects," said David Waters, H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e president. "Unfortunately, none of these processes translate to the theatrical release of the film as they must all be duplicated or repeated in either a higher resolution digital format, or photo chemical process."

H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e gives Motion Picture producers the ability to scan their selected original camera negative at 2k or 4k film resolution, conform a high resolution digital master for theatrical and broadcast release including dirt removal, opticals and visual effects, and output a High Definition preview master to be used for preview screenings and focus groups that can be deployed in any worldwide theater location.

"The challenge for completing the final editorial decisions on a motion picture are balanced between the ability to display the highest resolution picture for a test audience, and the costs and time in having to re-master your film based on a test audience response," said Jim Delany, H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e COO.

"H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e offers a flexible alternative to traditional photochemical and video post-production processes for film mastering and preview screenings eliminating cost and time redundancies," said Waters. "We expect our HD preview screening master services to provide crucial workflow efficiencies helping H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e achieve market growth in the current digital intermediate and high definition marketplace."

-----------------------
Timing is everything.  That's a real stem winder.   When it rains it pours.   The sharper is the berry, the sweeter is the wine. That's a real stem winder.   Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow. Up one side and down the other.   Putting it in a nutshell.   Run to seed.  Pull it up by the roots. Slow as a snail.   A thorn in my side.   A snail's pace. Treat him like dirt. Red as a beet.  They're like two peas in a pod.  Sitting on the fence. Red as a beet.  Sitting on the fence.

Throw pearls before swine. Root it out. A stick in the mud.   Sweating blood.   You feel like a fish out of water. Shiver me timber. The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  Watch and wait.  Stand your ground. Shit end of the stick. Sour as a green apple.   Water doesn't run uphill.   Put to bed with a shovel. Your ass is grass. The silly season.   You never miss the water till the well runs dry.
