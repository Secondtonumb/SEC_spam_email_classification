是因为自己的故事跟这首歌很相似？我只知道当我在听这首歌的时候眼泪不停的流?

原来有很多事是放不下就放不下，也没有办法可以勉强的。今天，在进课室考试之前，

我又碰见他，虽然只是挥了挥手，我却想了一天......

  Whenever sang my songs,
    on the stage, of my own
  Whenever said my words,
    wishing they would be heard.
  I saw you smiling at me,
    was it real or just my fantasy?
  U always be there in the corner,
    of this tiny little bar.

  I last night here for u,
    same old song, just once more.
  I last night here with u,
    maybe yes, maybe no.
  I kind of like it your way,
    how u shyly placed your eyes on me.
  
  Did u ever know that I had mine on u?
 
  Darling so where u r,
    with that look on your face.
  As if u r never hurt, as if u r never down.
  Shall I be the one for u,
    who pinches u softly but sure?
  If frown is showed then I will know that u r not dreamer.
  
  So let me come to u,
    close as I want to be,
    close enough for me,
    to feel your heart, beating fast.

  ... ...

  第一次听这首歌的时候，他站在我的身边，告诉我<Final Fantasy>的故事。当时我
 
真有冲动问： Did u ever know that I had mine on u? 可是，我始终说不出口......
