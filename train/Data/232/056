Different strokes for different folk  He That Will Not Be Counselled Cannot Be Helped 

  Visit your aunt, but not every day of the year Ask a silly question and you get a silly answer A barking dog never bites. Every rope gat two ends. Speak softly and carry a cellular phone. Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft He Lives Long Who Lives Well If the Blind Lead the Blind, Both Shall Fall Into the Ditch A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret.An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth From clogs to clogs in only three generations 
  Hungry nah know bam-by. Be a good sport - wherever you go  If Fortune calls, offer him a seat  Do not look where you fell, but where you slipped  Every Cook Praises His Own BrothEat well, stay fit, die anyway.  Talk is cheap Everything must have a beginning March winds and April showers bring forth Oct flowers You win some, you lose some 
  Attack is the best form of defence He knows best what good is that has endured evil  Eat well, stay fit, die anyway You can have too much of a good thingDon't cross your bridges before you come to them. The geek shall inherit the earth. If me bin know always deh behind de door. The modem is the message. The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination He is always right who suspects that he makes mistakes 
  Like father, like sonA friend in need is a friend indeed. There's a black sheep in every flock. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak A picture paints a thousand words. A golden key opens all doors. Age before beauty 
  You get out of life what you put into it He Lives Long Who Lives Well Always the bridesmaid,never the bride  The longest day must have an end Melt the icy fingers of fear with the sunshine of hope  When yuh buy ah dutty calico yuh gat fuh wear am till it tear. A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  Common fame is seldom to blame Beauty and Honesty Seldom AgreeRain, Rain, go away, come back another day The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones Tailors and writers must mind the fashion 
  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer! What we see depends mainly on what we look for He who plays with fire will get burnt For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. The looks ah de pudding is not de taste. A fair exchange is no robbery. I had no shoes and complained, until I met a man who had no feet  Bees that have honey in their mouths have stings in their tails 
  The longest rope has an end March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb There are two sides to every questionA Good Example is the Best Sermon. He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you Love conquers all If the Blind Lead the Blind, Both Shall Fall Into the Ditch Better to be safe than.. punch a 5th grader. Fax is stranger than fiction. Seldom seen, soon forgotten Turn the other cheek Two wrongs do not make a right 
  Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow
