      Doubt is the beginning of wisdom. I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger  Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage  Live and learn 
      People living in glass houses should not pelt stones. Actions speak louder than words. Whah hurt eye does mek nose run water. After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box
    
     
      A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog. They that dance must pay the fiddlerA barking dog never bites.
      Least said soonest mended Time waits for nobody Think Much, Speak Little and Write Less Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. Orange yellow but yuh nah know if he sweet. When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. All are not cooks that walk with long knives 
    
  
  Nah every big head get sense.Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow  A slip of the tongue is no fault of the mind and he who laughs is very unkind. Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. The longest rope has an end Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions Great starts make great finishes. Dont make love at the garden gate, love is blind but the neighbours aint Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse A cold bitter Christmas, a fat churchyard. A miss is as good as a mile. Experience is a great servant
