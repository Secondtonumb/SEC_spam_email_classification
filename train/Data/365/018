OhYeahCAD e-news, March 22, 2006
http://syl.262kkcb5v.com

In this issue:
1. New AutoCAD 2007 e-books from Ralph Grabowski.
2. Still free - Parts libraries for SolidWorks, SolidEdge, AutoCAD and Inventor.
3. Online parts library - did you know?

1. New AutoCAD 2007 e-books

It's been a while since Cadalog,Inc. sent out an OhYeahCAD e-news.  But we have added a couple of new books from Ralph Grabowski on the OhYeahCAD web store which we thought were note worthy. 

These are "What's Inside AutoCAD 2007" and "Tailoring AutoCAD 2007".  If you are considering upgrading to AutoCAD 2007, "What's Inside.." will be a worthy investment of $14.95.

2. Still free

Verson 4.1.1 of the Cadalog,Inc. parts libraries are still all free.  This includes SolidMech 4.1.1 for SolidWorks 2006, PartsNow for AutoCAD 2006 and Inventor and SE-PartsXL 4.1.1 for SolidEdge.

3. Online parts libary - did you know

Did you know that the OhYeahCAD online parts library supports: A. .SAT (ACIS files) which can be used in Alibre Design, IronCAD and a host of other CAD products,  B. TurboCAD native file format,  C. IGES - which can be used in programs like Rhino, D. a host of native formats like DWG, SolidWorks, Inventor and SolidEdge.

Thanks for your time,
David Wayne
President, Cadalog,Inc.
