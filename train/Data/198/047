Someone is probably planning a surprise for you. Different strokes for different folks. Make up your mind! Everyone will want something. Be prepared to say no, especially if it concerns money. Avoid situations that seem overly complex. Instead, choose to do things in the simplest manner possible. Focus on work and avoid personal issues or making promises to a group you know little about. Take a breather, work by yourself and you will accomplish what needs to be done. Ignore what's going on around you. Great day to invite friends to join you.

Can you avoid money? Today you may want to try! Take care of legal paperwork. Wedey will come in, but it will also filter out quickly. Today the stage is set for your relationships to improve and mature. Today, more people around you will differ in their beliefs from yours.

Participate in helping others today. There will be plenty going on behind your back, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. To feel your best today, spend more time socializing with others. For the best day possible, try showing off the qualities that make you different and unique. Everyone will want something. Be prepared to say no, especially if it concerns money. Spend time developing one of your many talents.

Try putting off any major purchases or investments.
