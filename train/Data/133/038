      April is the cruellest month To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity.
      When water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. Dont teach your grandmother to suck eggs Empty sacks will never stand upright The devil find work for idle hands to do

      The higher the tree, the sweeter the plum  A man is known by the company he keeps. To err is human, to forgive divine None but the wearer knows where the shoe pinches
