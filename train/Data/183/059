Feature Story:
Reporting Internet Crime - Untangling the Web

The complex web of Internet related crimes changes frequently
because cyber criminals work feverishly to outsmart Internet
safety measures. When a new scheme is unleashed through the
Internet that hardly resembles any of its predecessors, even the
most sophisticated Internet users can get tricked into it.
Therefore, some cyber scams are not unraveled until unsuspecting
victims have been lured into them. Whether you think you may have
identified a new Internet scam or believe that you have become
the victim of an Internet related crime, it is important to
report it. Forward thinking agencies have made it easy to report
Internet related crimes.  

Learn how to report Internet related crimes, follow the link
below:
http://ma.uy962t5m70.com/ct/93.b3f?t=68985&c=216441503&m=m&type=3

Although it would be great if you never have to report an
Internet related crime, it's good to know where to file a
complaint should you need to. There are many resources for
reporting Internet related crimes, but your first step should be
to contact the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), formerly
the Internet Fraud Complaint Center.
http://ma.uy962t5m70.com/ct/93.b3f?t=68985&c=216441503&m=m&type=3

Navigating the layers of government and identifying suspected
criminal behavior can be daunting for victims of cyber crimes.
IC3 removes those burdens by streamlining the reporting process
for anyone who believes they may be the victim of a cyber crime.
 

	
Reporting Internet Fraud

While the best method for fighting Internet related crimes is by
learning how to avoid it and by securing your PC with Internet
security software, help is available should it happen.

Family Safety

Social Networking: Teen Safety vs. Freedom of Expression
Teens can gain Internet access whether at home, at a friend's
and even in public places.  More than likely, your children are
not looking for trouble when they use the Internet. However,
teens are increasingly using social networking sites (e.g.,
ySpace, Facebook, Xanga, etc.) to post their profiles online
and build a social network among peers with whom they share
common interests. Parents are rightfully wary of the increased
use of social networking sites, because of reports of sexual
predators soliciting minors by obtaining children's personal
information through their postings on these sites.

The first line of defense against such threats is to provide
guidelines of safe Internet communication to your children.
Professionals agree that encouraging teenagers to think about
what they put online and teaching them to be alert during online
communication is much more effective than just levying rules. If
teens are taught to think about how information may be
interpreted or misused, and why certain responses can be
troublesome, they can apply those precautions wherever they have
access to the Internet. Furthermore, this gives teens the freedom
they need to feel as though they are thinking and acting
independently.
