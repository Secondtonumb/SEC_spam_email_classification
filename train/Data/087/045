      We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. Every Cook Praises His Own Broth
      Make hay while the sun shines Abstinence makes the heart go wander.
    
    
      Modulation in all things.Once seen never forgotten First come, first served 
      Football is a game of two halves Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  What you see in yourself is what you see in the world Least said soonest mended 
    
  
  Every Cook Praises His Own Broth Laughter is the best medicineOne volunteer is worth ten pressed men Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok.

Lightning never strikes twice in the same place.
