If in doubt, mumble A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.

      A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The Fairest Rose at Last is Withered All cassava get same skin but all nah taste same way. Great minds think alike, simple minds cant think of anything different
      You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb In the land of hope there is never any winter Birds of a feather flock together Gluttony kills more than the sword 
    
    
      What does not kill you makes you stronger Admiration is the daughter of ignorance The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. All good things must come to an end
      An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief. Revenge is a dish best served cold Speak when you are spoken to Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. 
    
  
  Murder will outA new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  Many hands make light work All good things come to those who wait. Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me Cat foot soft but he ah scratch bad. Fools and madmen speak the truth If dutty ah deh ah roof tap, yuh barrel ah catch am. C:\ is the root of all directories.
