A fool gives; a wise man takes.

      He that plants a tree plants for posterity There will be rubs in the smoothest road
      Every cloud has a silver lining A closed mouth gathers no feet.  He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
    
    
      Why bark when you can get a dog to do it When poverty comes in at the door, love flies out of the window 
      A friend to all is a friend to none.  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? They Brag Most That Can Do the Least 
    
  
  A house is not a home.  The modem is the message.Be kind to people on the way up, you may need them when you are on your way down Its a wise child that knows its own father After all is said and done, more is said than done  All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest  Never judge by appearences Old sins cast long shadows  Don't count your chickens before they're hatched .
