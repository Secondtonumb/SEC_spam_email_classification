      Half a loaf is better than no bread  A celebrity is someone who works hard all his life to become known and then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognized.  In vino veritas  A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall.
      Know which side your bread is buttered  Revenge is a dish best served cold Let bygones be bygones
    
    
      The difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  Love makes the world go roundEven in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief  Better to be alone than in bad company 
      A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  Laughter is the best medicine Old sins cast long shadows  A good lawyer must be a great liar. He That Brings Good News Knocks Hard 
    
  
  From the sweetest wine the tartest vinegarNah all who guh a church house ah guh fuh pray. For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life. You do well to believe in God Wedan also believes and trembles Forbidden fruits create many jams Every Soldier has the Baton of a Field Marshal in his Knapsack No man is an island Every best friend get a next best friend.
