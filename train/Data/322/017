CALL FOR PAPERS

EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION JOURNAL, 
IT PRESS

Special Issue on Evolutionary Computer Vision

Guest Editors
Gustavo Olague, CICESE Mexico
Evelyne Lutton, INRIA, France
Stefano Cagnoni, Univ. degli Studi di Parma, Italy

IMPORTANT DATES
Submission Deadline: *December 15, 2006*
First review:  March 1, 2007
Revision due:  Oct 1, 2007
Final decision:   August 1, 2007.

In recent  years, the evolutionary computation community  has shown an
increasing  interest  in what  is  now  called "Evolutionary  Computer
Vision"  due to  the rich  source  of problems  in which  evolutionary
algorithms can be used to develop theoretical and applied solutions in
areas of  human endeavor that matter.  We strive to  provide a highest
quality  special  issue  on  behalf of  the  Evolutionary  Computation
Community,  which  illustrates  the state-of-the-art  in  Evolutionary
Computer Vision.

We are soliciting papers on this topic to appear in a special issue of
Evolutionary Computation, MIT Press.  Papers appropriate to this issue
will have theoretical and experimental evaluation of vision algorithms
as  their  central focus,  with  the  application  cutting across  the
following areas, but which are not necessarily limited to:

1) Low-level vision

Evolutionary optimization, adaptation and learning algorithms for edge
detection,  image   segmentation,  figure-ground  separation,  texture
analysis, feature selection, shape-from-shading, denoising and surface
reconstruction.

2) High-level vision

Evolutionary  computation  for  object  recognition,  scene  analysis,
indexing and search of  model/image databases, and high-level learning
of symbolic descriptions.

3) Active vision

Evolutionary computation for autonomous vision-guided navigation, path
planning,  sensing strategies,  sensor  integration, visual  servoing,
vergence and gaze control,  hand-eye coordination, active tracking and
vision-guided task planning.

4) Neural vision

Evolutionary computation for  learning, adaptation and optimization of
neural network structure and topology for computer vision problems.


All submitted papers will be  reviewed according to the guidelines and
standards of Evolutionary Computation  MIT Press. The submissions must
be   made  electronically  on   the  Evolutionary   Computation  paper
submission  and  review  Web  site at  http://e4d.570.75/  before  the
deadline (please  also send an email  with the assigned  paper I.D. to
the  guest   editors).  Submitted  papers   must  describe  previously
unpublished  and  original research,  and  must  not  exceed 25  pages
including figures  and tables. The submission format  is flexible, but
the final  version of all accepted  papers has to be  written in LaTex
and has to meet the Journal format (see http://e4d.570.75/Formats/).
