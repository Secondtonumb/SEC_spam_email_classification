Is FPPL ready for lift off?
It could be ready to explode!

Whats happening with FPPL?

First Petroleum & Pipeline Inc. has now secured the rights to eleven
Federal Oil & Gas Leases in the States of Wyoming, New Mexico and Colorado.
The Company chose these target prospects based on proven reserves and
drilling success of fellow exploration firms in these Basin Regions. First
Petroleum's goal is to now focus on potential drill programs and development
of the most promising lease properties in its portfolio.

Some of the company's most encouraging prospects include the Powder River
Basin. Reserves of Coal Bed Methane in the Powder River Basin are estimated
at 31.8 trillion cubic feet. Nearly 100 wells are being drilled each week,
and the gas companies say the entire 25 million-acre basin could have 50,000
to 100,000 producing wells before they are finished. This is the largest
onshore natural gas play in North America within the last ten years.

The Uinta-Piceance Basin straddling the States of Colorado and Utah (with
an estimated 25 trillion cubic feet of gas and 60 million barrels of oil)
make it a prime target area as well. Nearly every major producer and
pipeline company in the U.S. is active within the State of Colorado; they
include Amoco, Conoco, and Unocal among others.

First Petroleum believes that future developments in their target regions
could give the resources necessary to build the dedicated management team
and to pursue further strategic acquisitions of proven or semi-proven
exploration targets. The Company will remain focused on this strategy.
