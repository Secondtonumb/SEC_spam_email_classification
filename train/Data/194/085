      More haste less speedA barking dog never bites. Robbing Peter to pay Paul
      And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway One, one dutty build dam. When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. Don't mind how bird vex, it can't vex with tree. 
    
  
  Happy the bride who.. gets all the presents.And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? Love is blind Cheats never prosper Opportunity seldom knocks twice An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth Fish and cast-net nah friend. Its only rock n roll but I like it Experience is the best teacher Fish and cast-net nah friend.
