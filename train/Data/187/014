Tomorrow never comes Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled  No one grows old by living; only by losing interest in living

      There's no place like 9ycc.com!. Fools and madmen speak the truth Nah every crab hole get crab.	 Faint heart never won fair lady Great minds think alike
      Virtues all agree, but vices fight one another  You can't teach a new mouse old clicks. Everything must have a beginning St Swithins Day, if thou does rain, for forty days it will remain, St Swithins day if thou be fair for forty days twill rain no more He That Brings Good News Knocks Hard Football is a game of two halves
    
    
      For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. Belly full behind drunk. Prevention is better than cureListen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise Every family has a skeleton in the cupboard Poor men seek meat for their stomach; rich men stomach for their meat
      Rain before seven, fine before eleven  A stitch in time saves nine. As is the gardener, so is the garden  He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son  
    
  
  Know which side your bread is buttered  A change is as good as a rest. Confession is good for the soulWisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets. Good gubby nah ah float ah tap. Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse. Too many chiefs and not enough indians The world is full of willing people: some willing to work and some willing to let them  It never rains, but it pours. There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem  One, one dutty build dam. Give a clown a finger and he will take your hand  An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief. Its only rock n roll but I like it No man is wise at all times
