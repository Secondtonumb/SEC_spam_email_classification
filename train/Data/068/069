      Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit. A lie well stuck to is as good as the truth. Spare the rod and spoil the child Time is a great healer
      One cannot quarrel without an opponent  Jack of all trades, master of none Take your time and time will take you  Football is a game of two halves
    
    
      Like flogging a dead horse The pot calls the kettle black. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.Many are called but few are chosen He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty A friend to all is a friend to none. 
      There but for the grace of God go I  The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. Adversity doesnt build character, it reveals it  A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness. You are never a loser till you quit trying 
    
  
  He who wants to do good, knocks at the gate, he who loves finds the gates openA crowd is not company.  A man walks, God places the feet.  Every picture tells a story What does not kill you makes you stronger One good turn deserves half the blankets Bad news travels fast Love sees no faults. Experience is the best teacher All you need is love Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  No wind, no waves
