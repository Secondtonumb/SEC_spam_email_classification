      You cannot lose what you never had A change is as good as a rest. The Mills of God Grind Slowly, Yet They Grind Exceedingly Small I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh. The early bird catches the worm
      Walls have ears  Diamonds cut diamonds
    
    
      Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit Zeal without knowledge is the sister of folly A stumble may prevent a fall. It takes one to know one
      A whistling women and a crowing hen are neither fit for God or men. Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl You cannot make bricks without straw  Yuh can't fatten cow fuh another man butcher.	 The higher the monkey climbs, the more he shows his tail You're never too old to learn. Never be afraid to sit awhile and think  Once bitten twice shy  For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 
    
  
  Every cloud has a silver lining A faithful friend is a medicine for life. Moon ah run till daylight ketch am.Handsome is as handsome does Desperate Diseases Call for Desperate Remedies The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. An idle mind is.. the best way to relax. Two heads are better than one Abundance, like want, ruins many. Good things come in small packages.
