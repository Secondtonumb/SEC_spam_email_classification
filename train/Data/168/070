Never speak ill of the dead

      God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers  None so deaf as those who will not hear  Fish ah play ah sea, he nah know watah ah boil fuh am. Use it or lose it
      Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets. Penny wise, pound foolish Two heads are better than one God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers 
    
    
      But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both
      Opportunity seldom knocks twice Beautiful is not what is beautiful, but what one likes  Every best friend get a next best friend. Age is a very high price to pay for maturity True love never grows old Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife 
    
  
  Fogiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the foot that crushed it The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Two heads are better than oneThe best things come in small packages Fruit out of season, sorrow out of reason If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause. Prevention is better than cure. For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger  It will all come out in the wash God defend me from my friends; from my enemies I can defend myself Daddies know best Caught between a rock and a hard place.
