The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory  Life is one long catwalk 

  Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. Laughter is the best medicine. Orange yellow but yuh nah know if he sweet. A golden key opens all doors.  Might is right Yuh can't chew bone with gum.Fear lends wings Its a dogs life 
  Fish and cast-net nah friend. Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel. A celebrity is someone who works hard all his life to become known and then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognized.  You cannot make bricks without straw  Ask a silly question and you get a silly answerWho keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. Half a loaf is better than none. Excess of ceremony shows want of breeding  
  Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat  A friend to all is a friend to none.  Christmas comes but once a year, but Hallmark makes sure it lasts three months When in doubt, do nothing Do unto others as you would like them to do unto youA lie well stuck to is as good as the truth. Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl To know the road ahead, ask those coming back You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb Although the Wed Oct Shine, Leave Not Thy Cloak at Home Youth is wasted on the young 
  When It Rains and the Wed Shines at the Same Time the Devil is Beating his WifeThe proof of the pudding is in the eating Only fools and horses work  A hedge between keeps friendship green. Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions One who has the reputation of an early riser may safely lie in bed until noon  You get what you give Dump husband in September, you have to get rid of the spidersThe pen is mightier than the.. pigs. 
  There is a time to speak and a time to be silent There is no time like the present A bad penny always turns up. A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  Better to be envied than pitied A fly will not get into a closed mouth. To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. Rained on ground hardens (Japanese Proverb)Fair exchange is no robbery  You can't teach a new mouse old clicks. A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog. 
  Speed thrills. Youth and Old Age Will Never Agree Never choose bedlinen or a wife by candlelight  Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.A child is a person who can dismantle in 25 minutes the toy it took you 25 hours to put together. You're never too old to learn. The first step is the hardest Empty sacks will never stand upright It's always darkest before.. daylight savings time. 
  It never rains but it pours I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.It takes all sorts to make a world Speed thrills. The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat Prevention is better than cure. Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly You cant hurry love  A stitch in time saves nine. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets. 
  Borrowed Garments Never Fit Well To err is human, to forgive divine
