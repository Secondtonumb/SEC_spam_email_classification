All good things come to those who wait. Never judge by appearences

      Always the bridesmaid,never the bride  A faithful friend is a medicine for life.
      Experience is the best teacher We all get heavier as we get older because there is a lot more information in our heads  Every family has a skeleton in the cupboard Prevention is better than cure. Half a loaf is better than none. The Family That Prays Together Stays Together
    
    
      Four things drive a man out of his house: too much smoke, a dripping roof, filthy air and a scolding wife Cultivate money and you grow rich, Cultivate mind and you raise cultureEvery path has its puddle.
      A wise son brings joy to his father,but a foolish son grief to his mother. After all is said and done, more is said than done  The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg A problem shared is a problem halved. He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon Never make a mountain out of a molehill - The mountain will arrive soon enough  
    
  
  A soft answer turneth away wrath. You have to understand, somethings you will never understand  Faith will move mountains.Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. All good things must come to an end Good gubby nah ah float ah tap. Shame face ah feel like cent ice. Loving life is living life to the fullest Everything comes to him who waits Quickly come, quickly go You win some, you lose some The Fairest Rose at Last is Withered Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves  Blue are the hills that are far away
