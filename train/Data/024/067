      The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. Mind your own business
      For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Abundance, like want, ruins many.
    
    
      True love never grows oldLend your money and lose your friend
      Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. After a famine in the stall comes a famine in the hall  A great dowry is a bed full of brambles.  Every Ass Loves to Hear Himself Bray You get out of life what you put into it 
    
  
  Actions speak louder than words.Rain ah fall ah roof yuh put barrel fuh ketch am. It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  Use soft words and hard arguments Well Begun is Half Done No Good Building Without a Good Foundation Second place is first loser My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path. Good talk saves the food
