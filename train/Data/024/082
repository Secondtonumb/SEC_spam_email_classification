      The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. One, one dutty build dam. Count your blessings Time and tide wait for no man
      The price of liberty is eternal vigilance Easy come, easy go True blue will never stain
    
    
      A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good. Nah everything scholar know he learn from teacher.
      He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill! Once bitten twice shy  It takes all sorts to make a world He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others 
    
  
  Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, cry and.. you have to blow your nose. Distance lends enchantment to the viewShe crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying. Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all  Virtues all agree, but vices fight one another  Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. Past cure, past care Pick your friends like you pick your fruit Melt the icy fingers of fear with the sunshine of hope  Look before you leap.
