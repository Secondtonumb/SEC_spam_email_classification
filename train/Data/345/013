<SUBJECT>壮志雄心（为即将毕业的你我送别）</SUBJECT>
<TEXT>
To me, memorizing English words is like courting a coy mm who forever
demands to be wooed.  It takes great efforts and determinations, tears
and toils, and even a lot of money to win her attention.  Even that
you cannot be sure that you have won her heart.  When I needed her
presence as I was speaking to some foreigners or writing some English
articles, she often heartlessly turned down my hearty invitation,
ignoring the relationship existing between us, left me standing before
the bewildered foreigners with my mouth open and tongue tied or sitting
before some sheets of reproachful blank paper, awaiting for her change
of mind to condescend to come.  But most often sleep came instead.

When I was asleep, thousands of pretty mm (I mean English words) came
before me with radiant smiles.  At that moment I could talk to Lincoln,
Einstein, Russell, E. M. Foster, etc in perfect English if only they
would come to life; at that moment I could write hundreds of
masterpieces in English literature if only i could get hold of a pen and some
sheets of blank paper; at that moment I might get a better
paid job with some fame instead of being a nobody.

Then I woke up, those pretty mm have gone and they retain their coolness,
in the notion that easy catch is of low price.  Alas!  What a paradox!
What I can do is to sing to myself "wherever you go and whatever you
do, I will be right here waiting for you." and "my heart will go on
and on!"
