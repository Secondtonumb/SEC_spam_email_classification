have poured on to the platform and the passage too if there had not been two
triple rows of soldiers, one from  the Sebastian cohort on Pilate's left and
on his right another from the Ituraean auxiliary cohort, to keep it clear.
     Pilate climbed the platform, mechanically clenching and unclenching his
fist  on  the useless  buckle and  frowning  hard.  The  Procurator was  not
frowning because  the  sun was blinding him but to  somehow avoid seeing the
group of prisoners which, as he well knew,  would shortly be led  out on the
platform behind him.
     The moment the white  cloak with the blood-red lining appeared atop the
stone block at the edge of that human sea a wave of sound--' Aaahh '--struck
the  unseeing Pilate's ears. It began softly, far away at the hippodrome end
of the square, then grew to thunderous volume and after a few seconds, began
to diminish again. ' They have seen me,' thought the Procurator. The wave of
sound did  not recede altogether and  began unexpectedly to  grow  again and
waveringly rose to  a higher pitch than the first and  on top of the  second

     He waited for a while, knowing  that  nothing  could silence the  crowd
until it had let loose its pent-up feelings and quietened of its own accord.
     When that moment came tlie Procurator  threw up his  right hand and the
last murmurings  of  the crowd expired. Then Pilate took as deep a breath as
he could of the hot air and his cracked voice rang out over the thousands of
heads :
     'In the name of imperial Caesar! . . .'
     At  once his ears were struck by a  clipped,  metallic  chorus  as  the
cohorts, raising lances and standards, roared out their fearful response:
     'Hail, Caesar! '
     Pilate jerked his head up straight  at the  sun. He had  a sensation of
green fire piercing his eyelids, his brain seemed to burn. In hoarse Aramaic
he flung his words out over the crowd :
