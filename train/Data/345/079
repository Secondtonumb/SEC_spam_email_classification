Why do you say you love her so much 
          while we see  both  you feel painful?
Do you real love her?
      I am so puzzled.
  If that is love,then 
          I don't think she will be pleased to accept it next time.
Since  you two fell in love,so called,she is often to be seen with sad feeling.
 
  Oh,so beautiful a girl with so much sadnesss.God grieve for her.
Why you bring her so heavy a burden?Just because you love her too much?!
  
   At last,you say Bye to  her but you act as a victim of that love.
I don't see  any real emotion for her in your eyes!
What you cared is only yourself!

   Poor girl.
Don't care about anything of him and forget everything ever happened between you 
  God bless you!
   Best wishes for you!
