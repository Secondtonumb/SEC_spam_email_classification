Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time.

Out my window a memory
I'm dying inside
I know the way it should be
Even though it was right in front of me
It's something I jsut couldn't see
You lonely face
You lonely eyes
This is something you can't disguise

When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you
I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you.

I'm carring this heavy load
I don't know what ot do
The only thing I know is that
I am in love with you
