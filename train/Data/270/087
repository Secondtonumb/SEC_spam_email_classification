Dear Wedend,

I crave your indulgence for the unsolicited nature of this letter, but it was borne out of desperation and current development. please bear with me.

y name is g4.fla8 Ogbodu,  an Internal Auditor of one of the leading banks in West Africa, here in this bank existed a dormant account for the past 25 years. 

When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from this account for this long period and our banking law stipulates that any un serviceable account for more than 12years will go into the bank revenue as an unclaimed fund.

y colleagues and I, have made our own personal inquiries about the depositor and the next of kin but sadly,the depositor and his entire family died in a plane crash, we only made this investigation just to be double sure of this fact and since we have been unsuccessful in locating the Relatives. I seek your consent to Present you as the next of kin of the deceased.
As  auditor in the bank I will use my position in the bank to present you as the next of kin to the estate,   so that the proceeds of this account valued at $15.4 million dollars can be transfered to you,this is the story in a nutshell.

Now I want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this x4920.aq13o25598, I had planned to destroy all related documents for this account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months I have worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account stands at-(US$15.4million US dollars).
Now my questions are:-

1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. What will be your commission/percentage? If you can sponsor this transfer.

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
All what we require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through, I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law, please get in touch with me by my e-mail to enable us outline to you our strategy on how to go about this, You may also send your phone number so that I can call you.
Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves,

I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this project. For Confidentiality sake do send your response to (v3v970r128@gmail.com)

Respectfully yours,

g4.fla8 Ogbodu
