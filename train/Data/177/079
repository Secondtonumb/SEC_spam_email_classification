    An 
      integrated view of protein evolution
       Csaba P Martin J. Lercher
      p337 
      | 10.1038/nrg1838
      Many 
      factors other than protein structure and function affect the rate of protein 
      evolution. Advances in genomics make it possible to assess the contribution 
      of all these factors and move towards a more integrated view of how proteins 
      evolve.

    Organizing

       C Julian Lewis
      p349 
      | 10.1038/nrg1840
      Stem-cell 
      systems all raise similar kinds of issues concerning the nature of the niche 
      and the differentiation process. Genetic studies of the intestinal stem-cell 
      system have made strides in providing generally applicable answers to such 
      questions.

    Mesoderm 
      induction: from caps to chips
       David Kimelman
      p360 
      | 10.1038/nrg1837
      Although 
      major molecular players with a role in mesoderm induction have been identified, 
      high-throughput approaches are beginning to yield data that will help us 
      to understand how the embryo integrates and processes the various signals 
      during mesoderm induction.

    High-throughput 
      RNAi screening in cultured cells: a user's guide

      Published 
      online: 25 April 2006
      p373 | 10.1038/nrg1836
      Carrying 
      out high-throughput, cell-based RNA interference screens involves making 
      a range of decisions, from choosing the cell type and reagents to picking 
      strategies for optimization and validation. Informed planning at each stage 
      allows the power of this approach to be maximized.

    Family-based

       Nan M. Laird  Christoph Lange
      p385 
      | 10.1038/nrg1839
      Although 
      they are sometimes overlooked, family-based designs provide important advantages 
      for detecting genetic associations in studies of complex disease. In particular, 
      they provide a means of overcoming the problems that arise when multiple 
      hypotheses are tested in genome-wide association studies.

      Inherited epigenetic variation - revisiting soft inheritance
       Eric J. Richards
      Published 
      online: 25 March 2006
      p395 | 10.1038/nrg1834
      A 
      growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic states can be influenced 
      by the environment. Considering that erasure of epigenetic marks between 
      generations is not universal among multicellular organisms, what are the 
      potential implications of inherited epigenetic variation for current theories 
      of inheritance and evolutionary change?

      D'Arcy Thompson and the theory of transformations
       Wallace Arthur
      Published 
      online: 25 April 2006
      p401 | 10.1038/nrg1835
      Understanding 
      how developmental processes are altered evolutionarily to produce changes 
      in organismal form is one of the great challenges of evo-devo research. 
      D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson deserves much credit for the inspiration his work 
      has provided for modern evo-devo.

    An 
      integrated view of protein evolution
       Csaba P Martin J. Lercher
      p337 
      | 10.1038/nrg1838
      Many 
      factors other than protein structure and function affect the rate of protein 
      evolution. Advances in genomics make it possible to assess the contribution 
      of all these factors and move towards a more integrated view of how proteins 
      evolve.

    Organizing 
      cell renewal in the intestine: stem cells, signals and combinatorial control
       C Julian Lewis
      p349 
      | 10.1038/nrg1840
      Stem-cell 
      systems all raise similar kinds of issues concerning the nature of the niche 
      and the differentiation process. Genetic studies of the intestinal stem-cell 
      system have made strides in providing generally applicable answers to such 
      questions.

    Mesoderm 
      induction: from caps to chips
       David Kimelman
      p360 
      | 10.1038/nrg1837
      Although 
      major molecular players with a role in mesoderm induction have been identified, 
      high-throughput approaches are beginning to yield data that will help us 
      to understand how the embryo integrates and processes the various signals 
      during mesoderm induction.

    High-throughput 
      RNAi screening in cultured cells: a user's guide

      p373 | 10.1038/nrg1836
      Carrying 
      out high-throughput, cell-based RNA interference screens involves making 
      a range of decisions, from choosing the cell type and reagents to picking 
      strategies for optimization and validation. Informed planning at each stage 
      allows the power of this approach to be maximized.

    Family-based

       Nan M. Laird  Christoph Lange
      p385 
      | 10.1038/nrg1839
      Although 
      they are sometimes overlooked, family-based designs provide important advantages 
      for detecting genetic associations in studies of complex disease. In particular, 
      they provide a means of overcoming the problems that arise when multiple 
      hypotheses are tested in genome-wide association studies.

      Inherited epigenetic variation - revisiting soft inheritance
       Eric J. Richards
      Published 
      online: 25 March 2006
      p395 | 10.1038/nrg1834
      A 
      growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic states can be influenced 
      by the environment. Considering that erasure of epigenetic marks between 
      generations is not universal among multicellular organisms, what are the 
      potential implications of inherited epigenetic variation for current theories 
      of inheritance and evolutionary change?

      p401 | 10.1038/nrg1835
      Understanding 
      how developmental processes are altered evolutionarily to produce changes 
      in organismal form is one of the great challenges of evo-devo research. 
      D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson deserves much credit for the inspiration his work 
      has provided for modern evo-devo.
