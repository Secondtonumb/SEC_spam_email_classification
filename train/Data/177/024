When you want fuh swim river yuh gat fuh plunge inside fuss. 

  as soft as velvet Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Love nature , live lightly Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself It is good to be knowledgeable, but better to be lovable Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. 
  Attack is the best form of defence Imagination is the highest kite you can fly Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Many things are lost for want of asking  God help the poor, for the rich can help themselves  When alone, we have our thoughts to watch, in our families, our tempers and in society our tonguesGrease is the only cure for a hangover He who awaits much receives little Live to the point of tears Half a loaf is better than no bread  Business before pleasure 
  A gentle heart is tied with an easy thread.  Work is the curse of the drinking classes No one is expected to achieve the impossibleNobody want dutty powder. No man is wise at all times  Fight truth decay, read the bible  Things are not always what they seem. Six of one, half a dozen of the other . One of these day is none of these days. 
  You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lambBetter wed over the mixen than over the moor A drowning man will clutch at straws. Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel. Business before pleasure Orange yellow but yuh nah know if he sweet. If in doubt, mumble Handsome is as handsome doesTo understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 
  Don't cross your bridges before you come to them. Have you ever noticed? anybody going slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac The female of the species is more deadly than the male The stylus is more potent than the claymore. Age is a very high price to pay for maturity A house is not a home.  He That Teaches Himself has a Fool for his Master Actions speak louder than words. Cold hands, warm heart If me bin know always deh behind de door. Better one house spoiled than two 
  The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  Love is blind There is a time to speak and a time to be silent Pardon all but theyself Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from itThere is an exception to every rule One man's meat is another man's poison.. A sly rabbit will have three openings to its den. Strangers are just friends you have not met yet Every Ass Loves to Hear Himself Bray 
  Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs A camel is a horse designed by a committee. What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts There are always ears on the other side of the wall  A child is a person who can dismantle in 25 minutes the toy it took you 25 hours to put together. Keep your friends close but your enemies closer There but for the grace of God go I  A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. The bigger the better. 
  Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit.
