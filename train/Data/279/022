What's good for the goose is good for the gander. 

  All good things must come to an end Every step of life is a risk  A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds. It is a long lane that has no turning All that glisters is not gold  The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait Do not search for a calf under an ox Man strength deh ah he hand, woman strength deh a she mouth. Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you 
  There is no time like the present Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger. It never rains but it poursThe rotten apple injures its neighbours Grow your own dope - plant a man! On the Turf all men are equal, and under it  Death pays all debts 
  Yuh can't drink mauby and belch beer. We do not care of what we have, but we cry when it is lost Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  Fine feathers make fine birds Visit your aunt, but not every day of the yearAll sunshine makes a desert  It is better to love and lost than never to love at all An old fox is not easily snared He Is Rich Enough That Wants Nothing 
  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others A gentle heart is tied with an easy thread.  Birds of a feather flock together Youth is wasted on the young He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day If in doubt, mumble Every flow hath its ebb The nearer to the church, the farther from GodNo man is wise at all times  If trousers say massah teef, yuh can't doubt am. 
  Fools rush in where angels fear to tread God helps those who help themselves as wrinkled as an elephant's hide The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat Don't byte off more than you can view.. The Gods Send Nuts to those who have no Teeth Tomorrow never comes When yuh buy ah dutty calico yuh gat fuh wear am till it tear.Nah every crab hole get crab.	 Every Soldier has the Baton of a Field Marshal in his Knapsack The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory  
  The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination He is an ill companion that has a good memory  Macaw ask parrot if mango ripe, he say one, one. There is illumination at the termination of the subterranean excavation. No husband has ever been shot while doing the dishes. Every dog has his day Turtle can't walk if he nah push he head outa he shell. Yuh gat fuh blow yuh nose where yuh stump yuh toe.	 To have is to hold and to hold is to have 
  He that plants a tree plants for posterity Death is the great levellerClothes make a man A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. Dead men tell no tales Fish and cast-net nah friend. After dark all cats are leopards Lear from the past, Live for today Look for tomorrow, take a nap this afternoon Be just before you are generous 
  If a son is uneducated, his dad is to blame They that walk much in the sun will be tanned at last
