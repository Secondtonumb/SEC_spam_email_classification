      Mother knows best Live to the point of tears
      A stitch in time saves nine. Your future lies before you like a field of driven snow Be careful how you tread it for every step will show
    
    
      No wind, no waves A fair exchange is no robbery.He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son 
      Old sins cast long shadows  A tree never hits an automobile except in self defense. The looks ah de pudding is not de taste. Walls have ears  
    
  
  History repeats itselfThink before you speak A stitch in time saves nine. Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see  Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Murder will out Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man. A bad penny always turns up. Time and tide wait for no man.
