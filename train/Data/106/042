Danger can never be overcome without taking risks  Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings Virtue is its own reward

      Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  The Absent are Always Wrong They Brag Most That Can Do the Least
      A hedge between keeps friendship green. True love never grows old Diligence is the mother of good fortune
    
    
      A book holds a house of gold. A crowd is not company.  Only knife ah know whah in pumpkin belly.	Fish and guests smell in three days You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf.
      It is a silly fish that is caught twice with the same bait  In vino veritas  It takes one bad apple to spoil the barrel! Blethers say nought Life is not all beer and skittles 
    
  
  In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashedDont count the days, make the days count! Be just before you are generous Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. A stitch in time saves nine. Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder We all get heavier as we get older because there is a lot more information in our heads  To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. Laughter is the best medicine.
