  (A Kiss for Kate, part II)


  I went into Kate's room. She sat in her chair, montionless, hands in her
  lap, staring. Taking her hands in mine, I said, "Kate, it's Phyllis."

  Her eyes never shifted; she only stared. I placed my hands under her chin
  and slowly turned her head so she had to look at me.
  "Kate, I just found out about Chris. I'm so sorry."

  At the word "Chris," her eyes came back to life. She looked at me, puzzled,
  As though wondering how I had suddenly appeared.
  "Kate, it's me, Phyllis. I'm so sorry about Chris."

  Recognition and remembrance flooded her face. Tears welled up and slid down
  her cheeks. "Chris is gone," She whispered.
  "I know," I said, "I know."

  We pampered Kate for a while, letting her eat in her room, surrounding her
  with special attention. Then gradually the stuff worked her back into the
  old schedule. Often, as I went past her room, I would observe Kate sitting
  in her chair, scrapbooks on her lap, gazing sadly at pictures of Chris.

  Bedtime was the worst part of the day for Kate.  Although she had been
  granted her request to move from her bed to Chris' bed, and although the
  stuff chatted and laughed with her as they tucked her in for the night,
  still Kate remained silent and sadly withdrawn. Passing her room an hour
  after she had been tucked in, I'd found her wide awake, staring at the
  ceiling.

  The weeks passed, and bedtime wasn't any better. She seemed so restless,
  so insecure. Why? I wondered. Why this time of day more than the other
  hours?

  Then one night as I walked into her room, only to find the same wide-awake
  Kate,I said impulsively,"Kate, could it be you miss your good-night kiss?"
  Bending down, I kissed her wrinkled cheek.

  It was as though I had opened the floodgates. Tears coursed down her face;
  her hands gripped mine. "Chris always kissed me good-night," she cried.
  "I know,"I whispered.
  "I miss him so, all those years he kissed me good-night." She paused while
  I wiped her tears. "I just can't seem to go to sleep without his kiss."

  She looked up at me, eyes brimming. "Oh, thank you for giving me a kiss."

  A small smile turned up the corners of her mouth. "You know," she said
  confidentlly, "Chris used to sing me a song."
  "He did?"
