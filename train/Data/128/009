      Think before you speak Nah because dog ah play with yuh he nah bite yuh.
      Stir With a Knife, Stir Up Strife Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see  If you lie down with the dogs, you'll.. stink in the morning.
    
    
      Attack is the best form of defence You can have too much of a good thingThe old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything
      Little things please little minds Good things come in small packages. One cannot quarrel without an opponent  Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly Watch your thoughts, they become words Watch your words, they become actions, watch your actions, they become habits, watch your habits, they become characer Watch your character, it becomes your destiny  
    
  
  In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashedOnce in a while, right in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives us a fairy tale The geek shall inherit the earth. Finders keepers, losers weepers He That Will Not Be Counselled Cannot Be Helped Keep your friends close but your enemies closer A faithful friend is a medicine for life. A stitch in time saves nine.
