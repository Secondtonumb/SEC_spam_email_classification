Dear Colleague:

The Organizing Committee is planning to have every presentation at ICCES07 to be of 25 minutes duration, plus 25 minutes of discussion.

A few Keynote presentations, that give a succinct general overview of the subject of a Session, would be chosen from among the submitted 25 page summaries of presentations. If you would like your presentation to be considered as a Keynote Presentation, please be sure to submit an appropriate over-view of recent accomplishments in a specific topic of interest to ICCES07. Authors of the chosen Keynote Presentations will be given  a modest reduction in the Registration Fees.

PLEASE NOTE THE ICCES07 DEADLINES:

-  Submission: Submit a 6-page paper directly to: http://6m534k9em0.s294p9ov7f5.com/icces07 by 25 August 2006.
-  Notification of Acceptance: 25 August 2006

At the same time, please help us update our database, by indicating your interest in participating in ICCES07, at:

http://syl.xm938.org

Thank you.

ICCES07 Organizing Committee.
