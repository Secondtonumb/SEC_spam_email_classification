Harrys heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up.
But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it? he asked abruptly. I
dont like it much, but its been useful, hasnt it? I mean: I saw that
snake attack Mr Weasley and if I hadnt, Professor Dumbledore wouldnt
have been able to save him, would he? Sir?
Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth with
his finger. When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as
though he weighed every word.Hi,
