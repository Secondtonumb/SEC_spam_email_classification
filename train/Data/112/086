      When the wine is in, the wit is out  A danger foreseen is half avoided. One cannot quarrel without an opponent

      He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword  Its too late to shut the stable door after the horse has boltedSilence is the fence around wisdom

Tongue nah gat teeth but he ah bite fuh true. A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. Better die with honor than live with shame Better one house spoiled than two
