I heard this from a man who. There was something big and black pistol-gripped in one hand and for one wild moment Paul thought it was a tear-gas gun. 


"Cover the windows, then! In desperation he pushed back the blankets with his hands for the first time, hoping against hope that it wasnt as bad as the shapes the blankets made seemed to suggest it was. It turned over, needling him from where it lay imprisoned in its cave of bones, and then fell lightly asleep again.
He could smell the sweat of her recent exertions, and while he actually liked the smell of fresh perspiration ? he associated it with work, hard effort, things he respected ? this smell was secretive and nasty, like old sheets thick with dried come. He looked up at the ceiling and saw the intertinked Ws waltzing drunkenly across the plaster. Lets look at the replay!   The pain went away and he drifted, feeling almost untethered from his body, a balloon of thought drifting at the end of a long string. For a moment he couldnt find Annie in the short, name-filled clipping, and then realized he was looking for the wrong name.
