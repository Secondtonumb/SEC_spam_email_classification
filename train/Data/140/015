      What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity Walls have ears  Life is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solvedSmooth seas do not make skillful sailors A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. Experience is a great servant

Fight truth decay, read the bible  In the land of hope there is never any winter The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
