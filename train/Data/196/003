      Seldom seen, soon forgotten A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. God is Always on the Side of the Big Battalions The looks ah de pudding is not de taste. Home is where you hang your hat
      A picture paints a thousand words. A man's home is his castle. A man is known by the company he keeps. Abstinence makes the heart go wander. He Lives Long Who Lives Well
    
    
      All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Fools build houses, and wise men live in them A Deaf Husband and a Blind Wife are Always a Happy Couple.Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage  You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
      Plant the crab tree where you will, it will never bear pippins  If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport. He Lives Long Who Lives Well Every devil has not a cloven hoof 
    
  
  Great starts make great finishes. Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea . The pen is mightier than the sword.Like father, like son Rain, Rain, go away, come back another day Wedlock is a padlock Speak when you are spoken to The early bird catches the worm, but it is the early worm that gets caught. It takes one to know one Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people  If a son is uneducated, his dad is to blame The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit
