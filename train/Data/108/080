	On silver necklaces they strung
	The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
	The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
	They meshed the light of moon and sun.
	Far over the misty mountains cold
	To dungeons deep and caverns old

	To claim our long-forgotten gold.
	Goblets they carved there for themselves
	And harps of gold; where no man delves
	There lay they long, and many a song
	Was sung unheard by men or elves.
	The pines were roaring on the height,
	The winds were moaning in the night.
	The fire was red, it flaming spread;
	The trees like torches biased with light,
