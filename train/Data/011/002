The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence

      He who awaits much receives little It is good to be knowledgeable, but better to be lovable  Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves  A faithful friend is a medicine for life.
      It never rains, but it pours. Mother knows best Better an open enemy, than a false friend
    
    
      Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness A watched pot never boils. When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern One man's meat is another man's poison..
      A book is like a garden carried in the pocket. Practice makes perfect. The tide never goes out so far but it always comes in again  Nothing ventured, nothing gained Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions 
    
  
  He who is ABSENT is always in the Wrong The world is full of willing people: some willing to work and some willing to let them  The Mills of God Grind Slowly, Yet They Grind Exceedingly SmallEveryday is a fresh slate You have to be in it to win it Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. Many hands make light work Two's company, three's.. the musketeers. Everything must have a beginning March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse You can only go as far as you push If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport.
