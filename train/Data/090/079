      Under the thorn grow the roses  An apple a day keeps the doctor away 
    
    
      The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence The course of true love never did run smoothA fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions.
      Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. As you sow, so shall you reap The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the mountain 
    
  
  Old friends and wine are best  Least said soonest mendedKeep your friends close but your enemies closer A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.

Softly, softly, catchee monkey  Many a true word is spoken in jest Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. Cleanliness is next to Godliness
