Red H0t News:

H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e Expands the Creative Palette for Independent Filmmakers GLENDALE, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--May 31, 2006 -- H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e, Inc. A provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced today that its Matchframe Digital Intermediate division is currently providing full digital intermediate services for Super 16MM productions.

H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e, Inc. (H Y W I - News), a provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced that High Definition preview masters as part of its normal digital intermediate service offerings and workflow.

"Typically, in current post-production workflow, HD dailies masters are edited into high quality preview masters including color timing, dirt removal, opticals and visual effects," said David Waters, H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e president. "Unfortunately, none of these processes translate to the theatrical release of the film as they must all be duplicated or repeated in either a higher resolution digital format, or photo chemical process."

H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e gives Motion Picture producers the ability to scan their selected original camera negative at 2k or 4k film resolution, conform a high resolution digital master for theatrical and broadcast release including dirt removal, opticals and visual effects, and output a High Definition preview master to be used for preview screenings and focus groups that can be deployed in any worldwide theater location.

"The challenge for completing the final editorial decisions on a motion picture are balanced between the ability to display the highest resolution picture for a test audience, and the costs and time in having to re-master your film based on a test audience response," said Jim Delany, H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e COO.

"H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e offers a flexible alternative to traditional photochemical and video post-production processes for film mastering and preview screenings eliminating cost and time redundancies," said Waters. "We expect our HD preview screening master services to provide crucial workflow efficiencies helping H o l l y w o o d  I n t e r m e d i a t e achieve market growth in the current digital intermediate and high definition marketplace."

-----------------------
The silly season.   Worked night and day. Walking on thin ice. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Tall as a tree.   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. A place in the sun.   Weed 'um and reap. Too little too late.   Tossed around like a hot potato.   Shit happens.   Stop and smell the roses. Rain, rain go away; come again some other day. Where man is not nature is barren. What goes down usually comes up.  That's water under the bridge. What goes down usually comes up.  When the cows come home.  Still water runs dirty and deep.   Your barking up the wrong tree. Spring to mind.   Were you born in a barn? Watch and wait.  The sharper is the berry, the sweeter is the wine.

The scum of the earth.   Up a tree. Pull it up by the roots. Timing is everything.  There may be snow on the roof, but there's fire in the belly. A stick in the mud.   What's good for the goose is good for the gander. You reap what you sow. Sweet as honey.   You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. Waking up with the chickens. Up a tree. Your all washed up. The silly season.   Treat him like dirt. Shake like a leaf. There's no time like the present.   Your name is mud.  Some like carrots others like cabbage. Spaceship earth.
