      as dirty as a pig Trust is the mother of deceit Dont teach your grandmother to suck eggs Many things are lost for want of asking 
      Laughter is the best medicine. Experience is a great servant
    
    
      Nothing ventured, nothing gained A watched pot never boils. From clogs to clogs in only three generationsOnly mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun 
      Don't put all your hypes in one home page. The more the merrier  Better to aim high and miss, than to aim low and reach target! Time and tide wait for no man 
    
  
  Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud Fogiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the foot that crushed it Discretion is the better part of valourEven in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief  You cannot burn the candle at both ends On the Turf all men are equal, and under it  Gentle is that gentle does  Dont teach your grandmother to suck eggs A constant guest is never welcome. The bigger they are, the harder they fall  You can only go as far as you push No Good Building Without a Good Foundation Things can only get better
