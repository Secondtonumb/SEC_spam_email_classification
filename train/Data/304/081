The plainclothesmans coat. The man getting out of the car was as old and well preserved as the car itself ? a Colorado Type if ever Paul had seen one.


Annie came into view for a moment. If she hadnt thrown the pitcher, he would have shattered it on the floor himself and tried to shove one of the broken pieces of glass into her throat while she stood there, as inert as an umbrella-stand.  And here came the car, with Rocket Man still trying to put on the brakes or bash the door open, and then. He knew one thing with some certainty ? a lot more was wrong with him than paralysis of the tongue, just as a lot more was wrong with what he had been writing than the missing key or the fever or continuity lapses or even a loss of guts. 
I have satisfied myself of that.   He managed to get to his hands and knees, fell forward, and then got painfully back up again. The movement ended the uneasy truce with the pain in his legs and the drug-need in his nerves, but it also diffused his terror a little.
