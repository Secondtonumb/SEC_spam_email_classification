* Conference background and goals 
The IADIS CELDA 2006 conference aims to address the main issues concerning with the 
evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in digital age. 
There have been huge advancements in both cognitive psychology and computing that 
have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines has never 
been faster before and this marriage has affected the very basis of the academia. 
Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivist approaches, student-cantered 
learning and collaborative approaches have emerged, and are being supported by 
technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agents systems 
to name a few. This merger has created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. 
This conference aims to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to 
these developments. Main tracks have been identified (see below). However innovative 
contributions that do not fit into these areas will also be considered as long as they are 
directly related to the overall theme of the conference. 

* Format of the Conference 
The conference will comprise of invited talks, oral presentations for discussion-oriented 
papers, and poster sessions for work-in-progress. The proceedings of the conference will 
be published in the form of a book and CD-ROM.

publish extended versions of their papers in Journal of Research on Technology in Education. 

* Types of submissions 
Full papers, Short Papers, Reflection papers and Tutorials. All submissions will go through a double-
blind refereeing process with at least two international experts. 

* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following areas: 
- Acquisition of expertise
