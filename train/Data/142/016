Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi . PK - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and 1www02yr4mz8.e80rh1 Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

-----------------------
Want my place in the sun.  Watch and wait.  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. She's a mother hen.   Red as a beet.  That's water under the bridge. Where man is not nature is barren. Plant kindness and gather love.   Your name is mud.  A tree does not move unless there is wind.   We hung them out to dry.  Stuck in a rut.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. She's a mother hen.   Rough as a cob. The silly season.   Under the weather. Stand your ground. Shake like a leaf. Your all washed up.

Play a harp before a cow. Thick as a brick.   The shoes on the other foot now.   Raking in the dough. When it rains it pours.   This is for the birds.   Tastes like chicken.   Where man is not nature is barren. Read the tea leaves. What's done is done.  Sweating blood.   Two peas in a pod.  Sour as a green apple.   A place in the sun.   Up a tree. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Spaceship earth.
