 Adaptor protein controlled oligomerization activates the AAA+ protein ClpC
Carlos Ibanez and colleagues identify Bex1 as a novel modulator of NGF signaling. Bex1 competes with RIP2 for binding of the p75NTR intracellular domain and thereby inhibits NF-B activity and NGF-dependent neuronal differentiation.



 Surveillance of nuclear-restricted pre-ribosomes within a subnucleolar region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
arcela Pekna and colleagues show for the first time that neural stem cells and neuronal precursor cells express receptors for complement proteins, C3aR and C5aR, and that mice deficient for C3 or C3a receptor exhibit impaired basal and ischemia-induced neurogenesis.
