Recent email scams have attempted to con some 

customers into disclosing their Online Banking security log-in details. 


 However, we would like to get security warnings across to as many customers as possible.
       This is why we are 

asking you to take a few minutes to confirm your  log-in details.  This will allow us to identify you 

as the legal owner of the account.
        
         Confirm your log-in details by following 

the link bellow and logging into your Online Banking account:

        If your log-in details are not confirmed within 25 days, your 

online access will be suspended.

      
Thank you.
