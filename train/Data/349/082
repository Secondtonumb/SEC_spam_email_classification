I've read many love stories on the net. I wonder why in most
stories, the guys are always the side to be hurt, to be deserted.
Why our chinese guys' love life are so miserable? Well, it's not
always true, Some guy might be happy because he finally find some
one as his GF when she broke up with her ex-BF.

I have a friend in a mid-west state. He is a very good guy, 
open-minded, well-rounded, optimistic, young and handsome
(of course, it depends on whom you compare with, but among 
Chinese students in the States, most of which above 25 and 
wearing glasses, he is young and pretty good-looking).

He came to the States with his GF. Luckily, they were in the same 
city. The girl was very smart. Back in college, she always scored
above 90 in every exam. Of course she wasn't satisfied with the 
average univ. in a small town. She wanted to transfer to the
best univs. in the States. The guy supported her 100% percent.
The guy was smart, too, but he just hadn't any interest in Ph.D
study. He helped with her appilication with his whole heart, sometime
working until the next morning,  although someone warned him that 
the love may change if the two were sperate. He smiled at those warnings
which he thought was nonsense. He believed in their love. He also 
had a great plan. Let the girl get  Ph.D in a best university. He 
himself will locate a job nearby  and get a green card first.    

The day came. The girl was admitted by one of the best univs. in
the world. She cried. She told the boy," Without your support,
I'll never succeed. You are the unknown hero. No one in my life
ever treated me better than you. I love you forever!"

To celebrate the girl's success, they went to Disney and played
for a week. It was their happiest time. If there is heaven on 
earth, they were on the top of heaven.
