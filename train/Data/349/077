Finally, he saw her. The same person, but different feeling. She seemed
so different and so distant. She told him that she wanted to break up 
with him because she had no feelings for him any more. It was no 
good for two people to be together if they didn't love each other any more.
The guy was mad. He cried aloud, " but I love you. you know I love you,
don't you???? can you give me any reason???" The girl also cried,
tears covering her pretty face, " I don't know. I'm really sorry, but I
just had no feelings for you any more. Please excuse me. You are a good 
person. You must be able to find a girl one hundred times better than me. 
I wish you good luck, really, and sincerely. I wish we can be friends."

The boy was despaired. He didn't know how he got back to his small town.
The world tumpled. He was so pround only a year ago. He was young. While
many of his classmates were still working hard toward their M.S. in China,
he was already in the States. His major was hot, so he could find a job
easily. He could soon buy a new car, a new house and everything. Above
all, he had a lovely GF, so he didn't need to visit BBS so often as
other Chinese students. But now, all were gone. He didn't know whom 
to believe because the person he trusted most betrayed him. 

He couldn't believe what happened and he was really desperate to find
out the truth. From his friend's friend's friend's friend, he began
to know sth. that might be the truth(of course, it depends on how much
you believe in hearsay). Not long after the girl arrived at the
new city, one gentleman stepped in her life. He was not yet 30, but
he had already been working at a famous investment bank on Wall St.
for serveral years with an earning of over $150,000 a year. He was 
successful, humourous, generous, versatile. He travelled all over 
the world and he earned a M.B.A from Harvard University! A mature man 
is always attractive to women around. Also, the young girl deeply
attracted this gentleman because she was young, pretty, smart and cute!
