Breaking News:

"Ice T" Teams Up With Rodedawg Int'l in an Endorsement of Newest Off-Road Vehicle -- Ice Calls Rodedawg "Wildest Thing on Four Wheels!"

HAYWARD, CA -- (xb4f.ge5 WIRE) -- 03/13/06 -- Rodedawg International Industries Inc. R'WG I  , the corporation which holds the rights to distribute and xb4f.ge5 the Chinese military vehicle that has turned into the hottest, newest off-road contender, announced the signing of "Ice T," hip hop music pioneer and accomplished actor/star in the award-winning series "Law & Order SVU," to a major spokesperson agreement to represent the Rodedawg. This off-road vehicle, which is also amphibious, will be going head to head with the Hummer and then some this year. Rodedawg is priced at half the cost of a Hummer, an attractive $49,500, which, when coupled with its ability to take to the water, should make it the off-road vehicle of choice for trendsetters.

After going out to see the vehicles and after meeting Rodedawg's CEO, Luis Pallais, Ice T was enthusiastic about the launch of the new extreme sports truck. "I thought it was the wildest thing on four wheels, and I know it will appeal to people who like to live on the edge," said Ice T. "This truck will turn heads." Ice T immediately agreed to represent Rodedawg, and more importantly, he will be deeply involved in all aspects of the product launch itself because of his ties to the extreme sports community through his Final Level Entertainment Group. Ice also wants to see this truck used in relief efforts here and abroad.

"We are very excited about our new relationship with Ice T," stated Rodedawg's Pallais. "I have been a huge Ice T fan, having watched him in 'Law & Order SVU.' He has always pushed the boundaries and definitely has the 'Street cred' this launch needs." The recreational uses of the Rodedawg are unlimited. If one enjoys outdoor adventures, exploring, boating, rugged trails, hunting, fishing or any other thing an adventurer might dream up, then the Rodedawg is the ideal extreme sports utility vehicle. If one is looking to stand out in a city setting, the Rodedawg is a match as well.


About Rodedawg:

Rodedawg International Industries has a very unique xb4f.ge5 position because it owns the exclusive worldwide xb4f.3o6bal and 5o.mb emark rights in almost every country around the globe, and because there is virtually no competition in the amphibious (land and water) vehicle xb4f.ge5. There are tens of thousands of Pootential fire and police departments that will have a need for a Rodedawg worldwide.

A cCommpany like Rodedawg International Industries, Inc. is unique in the billion dollar automobile industry by creating vehicles such as the new amphibious 4x4 off road vehicles manufactured in a joint venture by a major USA automaker and Beijing Automotive Works Ltd. that are designed to help in disaster areas.

The Rodedawg is priced at only $49,500 in most xb4f.r0he which will make it one of the least expensive pieces of equipment owned by police or fire departments for the specialized jobs it will perform.

This marvelous, adaptable vehicle does not even have any real competition, because a seventy thousand dollar boat will not perform on land, and a one hundred twenty thousand dollar vehicle like the HUMMER H1 surely will not swim on the water. The best news of all is the Rodedawg will have a price point fully equipped at under $50,000 in most xb4f.r0he.

The Rodedawg could be an ideal added solution to any disastrous flood or hurricane situation as a rescue and protection unit either by land or water.

Have fun in a Rodedawg! The recreational uses of the Rodedawg are unlimited. If you enjoy outdoor adventures, exploring, boating, rugged trails, hunting, fishing or any other thing an adventurer might dream up, then, you need to see, ride in, and own a new, exciting Rodedawg
