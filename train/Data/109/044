      So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. It is what is in the mind when sober, that comes out of the mouth when drunk 
      You cannot make bricks without straw  Time and tide wait for no man. A drowning man will clutch at straws. Great starts make great finishes.
    
    
      Beware of Greeks bearing gifts Hard work never did anyone any harm 
      Life is just a bowl of cherries. Necessity is the mother of invention Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse. A crowd is not company.  It takes one bad apple to spoil the barrel! 
    
  
  Beggars and borrowers cannot be choosers Mind your own business Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel.The bigger they are, the harder they fall  A man is known by the company he keeps.  Love many, trust few, but always paddle your own canoe Idle people lack no excuses  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Never too old to learn There's no place like 9ycc.com!. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? There is illumination at the termination of the subterranean excavation.
