Dear Family,

Just wanted to write you, and let you know, how the degree program I tried=
 out went.
Well, six weeks later, I graduated, finished & received my Maste~rss Degre=
e~
with no study required and 100 percent verifiable.

Yeah mom, I know you and Dad doubted it at first, but this turned out to b=
e
totally legit. This opportunity was given to me because of the professiona=
l
experience and previous course work I had accumulated.

I'm so excited mom and dad, this was a life altering opportunity & for onc=
e
in my life I took advantage of it.

I already have jobs, that wouldn't have given me a chance before, now they=

are calling off the hook! This really is a godsend.

Tell Susan and Cousin Joey that they better hurry up and call that # I gav=
e
them the other day. It's 206-984-4304 in case you forgot.

Again these are the Degr`ees they offer, BA, BSC, MA, MSC, MBA and PhD, an=
d
the number to call is 206-984-4304 , tell them to leave a brief message wi=
th
their name, the degree they are interested in and their day and evening ph=
one
numbers. They will contact you soon after.

Anyway, much love, and tell the rest of the family I said hello!

Love,
Dollie Chapman

With Love
