There appears to be a problem on this page of your site.

    On page http://syl.4207606.com/Xirtam/slove/67j32u43.r9y
    when you click on the Image:"l260779w.xji2s/service_s.u7h",
    the link to file://E:/jqzhou/dcamus/introduce/4cp47.r9y
    gives the error: Not found.
    Suggestion: The protocol "file:" only works locally, not across the Internet.
    Note: We just see the link, we didn't try to access your file.

As recommended by the Robot Guidelines, this email is to explain 
our robot's visit to your site, and to let you know about one of 
the problems we found. We don't store or publish the content of 
your pages, but rather use the link information to update our map 
of the World Wide Web.

Are these reports helpful? I'd love some feedback. If you prefer 
not to receive these occasional error notices please let me know.
