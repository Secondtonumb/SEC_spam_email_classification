Wedends,

I feel compelled to post about a product that has made an
extraordinary difference in my life.

For years I resisted drugs, especially so-called "lifestyle drugs"
that people took for what I thought was no good medical reason.  I
thought people who resorted to anti-depressants and such were weak,
and lacked the fortitude to take responsibility for their own lives.

But I've changed my mind.  I was recently in an early user trial for a
new erectile dysfunction medication called Cialis.  It has brought new
joy to my life.  I have regained the vitality of youth, but it's
better now because I have the confidence and serenity of age.

Claire and I are so glad we discovered Cialis.  I had forgotten how
much physical intimacy deepens relationships and brings expressions of
love to new levels.  If it's possible for a medicine to help you love,
Cialis is it.  Our commitment to each other is stronger than ever, and
our love has reached new levels of passion.

Again, I resisted for so long, but now I'm so happy I tried Cialis.
It has made a tremendous difference in my life and I think it will in
yours also.
