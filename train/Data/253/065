Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred

      Look before you leap The end justifies the means The truth will out
      The early bird catches the worm Don't cross your bridges before you come to them.
    
    
      Time wounds all heels. A book holds a house of gold.A bus is a vehicle that runs twice as fast when you are after it as when you are in it.
      A fool and his money are soon parted. Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred  A golden key opens all doors.  Not to know is bad; not to wish to know is worse  
    
  
  You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds Eat well, stay fit, die anyway. When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft Better safe than sorry Love is the strangest thing Rats desert a sinking ship Macaw ask parrot if mango ripe, he say one, one.
