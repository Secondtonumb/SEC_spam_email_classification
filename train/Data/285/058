      One who has the reputation of an early riser may safely lie in bed until noon  Life is one long catwalk A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. Happy the bride who.. gets all the presents.

      Handsome is as handsome does Don't put all your hypes in one home page.A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  Every Cook Praises His Own Broth Softly, softly, catchee monkey
