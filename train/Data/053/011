      A man is at his tallest when he stoops to help a child. One beats the bush, another takes the bird A miss is as good as a.. Mr..
      Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . No man is an island
    
    
      To know the road ahead, ask those coming backIt ain't over 'till it's over. Motivation is what gets you started habit is what keeps you going

If you believe everything you read, you better not read He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
