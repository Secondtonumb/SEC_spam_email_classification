      Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me He that plants a tree plants for posterity If dutty ah deh ah roof tap, yuh barrel ah catch am.
      There is a time and a place for everything Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. A Fool Oct Give a Wise Man Counsel. A house is not a home.  Turn the other cheek Look good, feel good
    
    
      For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.Rain, Rain, go away, come back another day Never guh a store ah night fuh buy black cloth.
      Nah mind how pumpkin vine run, he must dry up one day. Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled  Share and share alike! One kiss nah done lips. Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man. Practice makes perfect. If you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher  
    
  
  Wise men think alike.Death pays all debts A picture paints a thousand words. Stir With a Knife, Stir Up Strife It is better to love and lost than never to love at all Football is a game of two halves Never judge by appearences Better to be safe than sorry Confession is good for the soul
