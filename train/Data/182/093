OTCBB: SYNISavvy traders know that companies with promising futures in the bio fuel and alternative energy market are generating huge attention from the inv!
 estment community.  Just look at Xethanol (OTC: XTHN) and Pacific Ethanol (NASDAQ: PEIX), securities that have provided outstanding returns in a matter of weeks.So it makes sense to suggest that stocks trading in this sector can be highly lucrative.Given the bright future of its exclusive technologies which generate clean renewable energy, SYNI management foresees huge short and long-term profit potential for shareholders.And clearly, aggressive traders are in a position to benefit !
 from stocks capitalizing on this booming global trend.Overall, it is an opportunistic time for investors to watch the stock at the current low trading price to benefit from considerable capital appreciation in the near future.{{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}} {{r0}}
