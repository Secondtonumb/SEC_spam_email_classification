Art has no enemy but ignorance Anybody can make history Only a great man can write it  

  Cat a ketch rat, but he a teef he massa fish. Well done is better than well said Good broth may be made in an old pot When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise Wasteful man money ah guh like butter in de sun. The e-mail of the species is more deadly than the mail.Its only rock n roll but I like it Your future lies before you like a field of driven snow Be careful how you tread it for every step will show 
  Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man. Great minds think alike Past cure, past care Eat well, stay fit, die anyway Revenge is a dish best served cold. Yuh can't chew bone with gum.Those who cast the votes decide nothing Those who count the votes decide everything  After all is said and done, more is said than done  Baby who ah cry ah house and ah door ah same thing. The pot calls the kettle black 
  Make hay while the sun shines Beggars and borrowers cannot be choosers Every man has his price A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog. Fight truth decay, read the bible  Fair exchange is no robbery More haste less speed He That Brings Good News Knocks Hard Like music to my ears Let sleeping dogs lie. He who knows better has never tried it Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. Mother knows best 
  A sly rabbit will have three openings to its den. He Is Rich Enough That Wants NothingWasteful man money ah guh like butter in de sun. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence Little things please little minds Old friends and wine are best  Good broth may be made in an old pot Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree Spare the rod and spoil the child Love laughs at the locksmithsFamiliarity breeds contempt Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you 
  Corporations have neither bodies to be punished nor souls to be damned  Its a wise child that knows its own father Life is just a bowl of cherries.

Two heads are better than one A dog who attends a flea circus most likely will steal the whole show. Better one house spoiled than twoThings that come to those who wait may be things left by those who got there first  The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom Greedy folks have long arms  
  United we stand, divided we fall  Prevention is better than cure. Stir With a Knife, Stir Up Strife An idle mind is.. the best way to relax.What we see depends mainly on what we look for  Better to be safe than sorry Let bygones be bygones And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. He Who Keeps Company with the Wolf Will Learn How to Howl 
  Know which side your bread is buttered  A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Easy come, easy go Imagination is the highest kite you can fly Misery loves company All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy The Moon does not heed the barking of dogs  Take your time and time will take you  Common fame is seldom to blame Hunger is the best sauce 
  He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword  The best things in life are free
