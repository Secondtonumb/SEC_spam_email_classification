FEATURE PAPER
Capital Standards and Risk Alignment in the Banking Firm
The following paper was presented at the 2006 Allied Academies Spring Conference held in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was written by Guy Ford, of Macquarie University and Maike Weddmacher of University of Western Sydney.
Abstract
This paper examines the question of how to efficiently align the investment decisions of managers in a bank with the risk/return goals of the centre of the bank. It argues that the contemporary approach aimed at achieving such alignment, which involves the top-down allocation of some proportion of the total bank?s capital against positions taken by managers, and then remunerating managers based on the return generated on this capital, serves as a poor mechanism for achieving alignment of incentives. This arises when bank capital is measured in terms of a predetermined solvency standard, which has at is core a risk-neutral attitude to risk. If bank stakeholders are risk-averse, and desire that this risk attitude be captured in bank investment
decisions, then risk measures used internally for investment selection and performance measurement must diverge from those used to measure total bank capital.
Introduction
This paper examines the troubling question of how to efficiently align the investment decisions of managers in a bank with the risk/return goals of the centre of the bank. It argues that the contemporary approach aimed at achieving such alignment, which involves the top-down allocation of some proportion of the total bank?s capital against positions taken by managers, and then remunerating managers based on the return generated on this capital, serves as a poor mechanism for achieving alignment of incentives. Indeed, it is argued that this approach leads to outcomes that are against the best interests of bank stakeholders whom the centre is deemed to represent. This problem arises when bank capital is measured in terms of a predetermined solvency standard, which has at is core a risk-neutral attitude to risk. If bank stakeholders are risk-averse, and desire that this risk attitude be captured in bank investment decisions, then risk measures used internally for investment selection and performance measurement must diverge from those used to measure total bank capital.

TIP OF THE WEEK 
Preparing a Loan Proposal
All bankers want to hear how the loan they will provide will improve the worth of the company. To improve the chance of coming away with the loan, the entrepreneur should tailor the presentation to address this question. A loan proposal consists of eight parts. Using the information from the business plan, the entrepreneur should shift the emphasis toward the new audience to convert it into a loan proposal. Here are some guidelines to assist the entrepreneur in preparing a loan proposal:
1. Summary. On the first page, the entrepreneur should give his or her name and title, company name and address, nature of business, amount sought, purpose, and source of repayment.
2. Management Team Profiles. A biography should be prepared on the entrepreneur and the management team, with emphasis on business background, education, experience skills, areas of expertise, and accomplishments. Bankers seek their ultimate security in experienced management.
3. Business Description. Details on the legal structure, number of employees, union status, and current business assets should be provided. The products and markets as well as customers and competitors should also be defined, along with inventory in terms of size, rate of turnover, and market ability. The status of your accounts receivable and accounts payable should also be reported.
4. Projections. The entrepreneur should show projections on the current share of the market and describe how he or she plans to exploit these opportunities for the next three years. The alternative and fallback plans, as well as a realistic timetable for achieving the goals, also need to be listed. Bankers judge plans and goals in terms of the industry's practices and trends.
5. Financial Statements. The entrepreneur should prepare a balance sheet and income statement for the past three years (if available). Bankers are more comfortable with audited statements. If the entrepreneur cannot afford a full audit, he or she should ask the accountant for a financial "review." Though less convincing than an audit, this new intermediate procedure gives the banker more assurance than an unaudited statement. Two sets of projected balance sheets as well as income and cash flow statements should also be prepared, one predicated on receiving the loan and the other on proceeding without it. Though critical to proving the entrepreneur's claim that the loan will increase company worth, the projections must be realistic. Bankers match projections against published industry standards, searching for padded earnings and meager cost estimates. Personal financial statements, including tax returns for the past three years, must also be submitted, since the entrepreneur's own net worth is a factor. Bankers check the entrepreneur's personal credit rating in addition to the company. 
6. Purpose. The purpose of the loan should be stated. A request for "working capital" will elicit questions, not money. Instead, explain specifically what the intended use of the working capital is-for example, to build up Christmas inventory by increasing productions, starting in late summer.
7. Amount. The entrepreneur should ask for the premise amount needed to achieve his or her purpose and support the figures with estimates or previous cost figures. Bankers know costs, so the entrepreneur should not ask for a high amount, expecting his or her request to be negotiated. The banker will verify all requested amounts.
8. Repayment Plans. The asset must match the loan. Any asset the entrepreneur wants to finance must last at least as long as the loan period. Also, the asset should generate the repayment funds by increasing sales, slashing costs, or heightening efficiency. Weaving these into a repayment schedule is a complex task, but the entrepreneur will not be required to do it all alone. Lending officers anticipate calls for advice on this and all other elements of loan proposals. They look to the entrepreneur to be an expert only on the business; however, he or she will be expected to come in with all the requisite financial data.
