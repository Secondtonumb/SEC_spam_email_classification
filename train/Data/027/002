don't know why,he loved phoning me,and i would receive his
phone,yawning,not care in the least.he said he looked serious
every day in his company,but chatting with me maked him happy,
i replied i was so kind,he asked me why,i never asked you for 
fee i answered.he burst out a fit laughter again,sometimes even
out of breath for my nonsence.i remeber we chatted so long one
noon ,destroyed my regular schedule,robbed of my nap and drove
me mad,so he changed for afternoon the next day.and he would
make believe don't know anything so i could enjoy teaching him 
this and that,i told him the marrige between jiangjieshi and 
songmeiling was politics (god,he even never know this!stupid)and 
what was his disposition from his astrology(he even never know 
this!exhausted)in the end,he would say:oh,you tought me so much,
would you please let me teach you something?then i gave in and 
had to bear the boring rubbish he taught me later.
he will left for canada or hongkong soon,"will you follow me ,
after so many phones?"he once joked,"you really crazy"i sneered,
"i am not a child,i am an adult ,guy"
now he is not here,but i recalled his gentle voice and his 
phones.and what is rational?to keep one from hurting or from 
happiness?sometimes i hate my face ,my body,myself.i shouldn't
have been born.
