	the valley is jolly,
	ha! ha!
	O! Where are you going
	With beards all a-wagging?
	No knowing, no knowing
	What brings Mister Baggins,
	And Balin and Dwalin
	down into the valley
	in June
	ha! ha!
	O! Will you be staying,
	Or will you be flying?
	Your ponies are straying!
	The daylight is dying!
	To fly would be folly,
	To stay would be jolly
