  VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 9, 2006--Falcon Energy, Inc. 
  (Pinnk Sheeets:2wv2.67 - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired 
  the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region 
  of Wedgolia. Management felt that the opportunity presented by these properties 
  was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource 
  company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant 
  Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties. 
  Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held 
  include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well 
  as Fluorite and Uranium.<br>
  <br>
  Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount Westlock property 
  in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and 
  investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since the well 
  was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that 
  time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed over 
  10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range. 
  The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue 
  for the company and its shareholders.<br>
  <br>
  Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed addition of 
  its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding 
  the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will 
  be forthcoming. <br>

  Patience is a virtue Yuh can't suck cane and blow whistle. Hunger is the best sauce I had no shoes and complained, until I met a man who had no feet  There's no place like 9ycc.com!. Don't byte off more than you can view.. To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. <BR><BR>The young man thinks the old mans stupid but the old man KNOWS the young man is The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Fight truth decay, read the bible  The stick is the surest peacemaker The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world Fine words butter no parsnips <BR><BR><BR>He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you 
  The country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers - japanese proverb There are two sides to every question Lucky at cards, unlucky in love The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait Teaching of others teacheth the teacher You cant hurry love  Like father, like son.<BR><BR>Give and spend and God will send Better one house spoiled than two All roads lead to Rome Love is blind. For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
