Joke of the Day:

If Microsoft Built Cars 

1. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new 
car. 
2. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would 
just accept this, restart and drive on. 
3. Occasionally, executing a maneuver would cause your car to stop and fail and 
you would have to re-install the engine. For some strange reason, you would 
accept this too. 
4. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you bought 
. But, then you would have to buy more seats. 
5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five 
times as fast, twice as easy to drive - but would only run on 25 percent of the 
roads. 
6. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft upgrades to their 
cars, which would make their cars run much slower. 
7. The oil, gas and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single 
 warning light. 
8. The air bag system would say,  before going off. 
9. If you were involved in a crash, you would have no idea what happened.
