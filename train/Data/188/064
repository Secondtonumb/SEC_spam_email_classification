		Hello,
		   Calls to friends and family on Skype have always been free. Now we've made calls within the US and Canada to all phones totally free till the end of the year.
		  Starting from today it doesn't matter if it's a Skype-to-Skype call or a call to landline or mobile phone - it's free as long as you're calling from within the US or Canada to US or Canadian phone number.

		  Calling with Skype is easy - select someone from your contact list, or dial a number and hit the green call button. This is how to make a call.
		
	

	
		
		
		
	



  
    
    How can we do this? Well, we hope our customers will support us by using Skype to make international calls at incredibly cheap rates, or by buying stuff from our store - like Skype Voicemail, perhaps an accessory like headphones to make using Skype even easier, or even a cool ringtone to personalize your Skype.
