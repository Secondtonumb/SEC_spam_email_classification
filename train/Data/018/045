There was excitement in the camp that night. In the morning they 
prepared to move once more. Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to 
guard the ponies and such stores as they had brought with them from the 
river. The others went down the valley and up the newly found path, and 
so to the narrow ledge. Along this they could carry no bundles or packs,
so narrow and breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred and fifty feetHi
