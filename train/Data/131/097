      As you make your bed, so must you lie in it Gentle is that gentle does  What goes around, comes around  Belly full behind drunk. Good broth may be made in an old pot
      But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. If Fortune calls, offer him a seat  At the end of the game, the King and the pawn go back in the same box The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
    
     
      Practice makes perfect What flares up fast, extinguishes soon Half a loaf is better than no bread Everyone stretches his legs according to the length of his coverlet Never too old to learn When fortune smiles, embrace her
      You have to be in it to win it Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . Great starts make great finishes A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor. Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. 
    
  
  Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it  There is a skeleton in every cupboard Under the thorn grow the roses  Keep your powder dry  A man is judged by his deeds, not by his words. To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. One volunteer is worth ten pressed men True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls  Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice Cuss when yuh ah guh, nah wheh yuh ah come out. A bus is a vehicle that runs twice as fast when you are after it as when you are in it. The more one knows, the less one believes Once a word leaves your mouth, you cannot chase it back even with the swiftest horse All good things come to he who waits  Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
