      Every Soldier has the Baton of a Field Marshal in his Knapsack What boots up must come down. A man's reach should exceed his grasp. Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree The pen is mightier than the sword
      My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. The best doctors are Dr Diet, Dr Quiet and Dr Merryman Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount
    
    
      Practice what you preach  Life is just a bowl of cherries. Haste makes waste.You cannot get blood from a stone
      All you need is love God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers  Its a wise child that knows its own father Turn the other cheek When coconut fall from tree he can't fasten back. 
    
  
  One foolish sheep will lead the flock Danger can never be overcome without taking risks  A good man is hard to find.Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  A danger foreseen is half avoided. A cat may look at a king. Nah everything scholar know he learn from teacher. Rats desert a sinking ship. Rained on ground hardens (Japanese Proverb) A dog who attends a flea circus most likely will steal the whole show. When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way. Only knife ah know whah in pumpkin belly.
