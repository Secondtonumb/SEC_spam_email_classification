      He Is Rich Enough That Wants Nothing On the Turf all men are equal, and under it  Everyone must row with the oars he has.
      A place for everything and everything in its place. A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain. The best things in life are free No one grows old by living; only by losing interest in living Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong
    
    
      Do not search for a calf under an ox  Only when all contribute their firewood can they build up a strong fireGood gubby nah ah float ah tap. Macaw ask parrot if mango ripe, he say one, one.
      What goes up must come down The tide never goes out so far but it always comes in again  When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit. If practice makes perfect and nobody's perfect then why practice?. 
    
  
  Know what to expect before you connect. Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes softA reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. Time heals all wounds. A cat may look at a king. A house is not a home.  Once seen never forgotten A faithful friend is a medicine for life. An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  Lightning never strikes twice in the same place. A baby is an alimentary canal with a loud voice at one end and no responsibility at the other. We had nothing to do and we did it very well
