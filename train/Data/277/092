To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding. Nothing seems expensive on credit He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon

      What boots up must come down. A closed mouth gathers no feet. 
      He who is ABSENT is always in the Wrong A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Fine feathers make fine birds
    
    
      God made the country and man made the town! Belly full behind drunk. Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wiseThe pen is mightier than the sword. Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give Never judge someone until you have travelled a mile in their shoes
      Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Distance makes the heart grow fonder One good turn deserves another. Seeing is believing A miss is as good as a mile. The devil find work for idle hands to do 
    
  
  There is no time like the presentYou are a long time dead Wedey is the root of all evil  Grease is the only cure for a hangover Least said soonest mended We had nothing to do and we did it very well  Its a dogs life Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you Lear from the past, Live for today Look for tomorrow, take a nap this afternoon An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief. Penny wise, pound foolish If you wish to be loved, love Laughter is the best medicine Abstinence makes the heart go wander.
