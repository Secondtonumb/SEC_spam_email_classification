      What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left We had nothing to do and we did it very well 
      Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. Things are not always what they seem. Bitter pills may have blessed effects He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin
    
     
      Good people are scarce Better one house spoiled than twoQuality is better than quantity  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
      Share and share alike! Hunger is the best sauce But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. It is a silly fish that is caught twice with the same bait  A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.  Like father, like son. 
    
  
  Love laughs at the locksmiths A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones. When alone, we have our thoughts to watch, in our families, our tempers and in society our tongues When water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. Nothing seems expensive on credit Never put your tongue on an iceberg A best friend is like a four leaf clover, Hard to find and lucky to have. A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.  A wonder lasts but nine days.
