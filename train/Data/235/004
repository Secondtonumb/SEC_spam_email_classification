Greeting, 
In appreciation of your esteemed contact   received through a reliable 
source and the  choice of your country I wish  to introduce myself. I 
am Prince Michael William  kishali Duke the  first son of His Royal 
ajesty, WIWA DUKE  and the traditional ruler of Eleme Province in  the 
oil area of Rivers State of Nigeria. I am  making this contact to you 
in respect of US 45,000,000.00, which I inherited, from my late  
father. This funds was accumulated from  royalties paid to my father as 
compensation  by the oil firms located in our area as a result   of oil 
presence on our land which hamper   agriculture which is our major 
source of   livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from   protracted 
diabetes. But before his death he called  my attention and informed me 
that he lodged  some funds with a security firm and Security  Code 
Number which was also revealed to me, he  then advised me to look for a 
reliable  business partner abroad, who will assist me  in investing the 
funds in a lucrative business  as a result of economic instability in 
Nigeria. 
I and my family have unanimously decided to   give you 20% of the 
total funds, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may  arise 
during the transaction, fax and phone  bills inclusive. The balance of 
75% you will  invest and manage for my family. I hereby  guarantee you 
that this is not government funds, it is not drug funds and it is not 
funds  from arms deal.I will give you all proof of deposit and 
existence of funds once urged and fully satisfied with your capability 
and  honesty. I hope this will be the beginning of a  prosperous 
relationship between my family  and your family. Nevertheless if you 
are for any reason not  interested, kindly inform me immediately so 
that I will look for another  contact.
