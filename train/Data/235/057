      A barking dog never bites. It is better to wear out than to rust out Home is where the heart is Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to use the Net and he won't bother you for weeks. Old habits die hard
      Necessity is the mother of invention One years seeding means seven years weeding
    
    
      Only fools and horses work  Forbidden fruits create many jamsVice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. Every Soldier has the Baton of a Field Marshal in his Knapsack There is a time and a place for everything
      Work is the curse of the drinking classes Beauty is in the eye of the beholder Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone A hedge between keeps friendship green. Know what to expect before you connect. Fine feathers make fine birds After dark all cats are leopards 
    
  
  He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount Fish ah play ah sea, he nah know watah ah boil fuh am. The higher the tree, the sweeter the plum A happy heart is better than a full purse.  Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  Cleanliness is next to Godliness God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Its a dogs life The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
