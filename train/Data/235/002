Talking of the baron's ancestor
puts me in mind of the baron's great claims to respect, on the score of his
pedigree. I am afraid to say, I am sure, how many ancestors the baron had; but I
know that he had a great many more than any other man of his time; and I only
wish that he had lived in these latter days, that he might have had more. It is
a very hard thing upon the great men of past centuries, that they should have
come into the world so soon, because a man who was born three or four hundred
years ago, cannot reasonably be expected to have had as many relations before
him, as a man who is born now. The last man, whoever he is - and he may be a
cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we know - will have a longer pedigree
than the greatest nobleman now alive; and I contend that this is not
fair
