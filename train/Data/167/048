Dear Yingzi Kang,

   I hope that the procedure for your visa has been completed or, at least, is in good progress. Will you finally be able to come to Crete? If yes, we would appreciate if you could send us the registration form as soon as possible.
   Thank you very much for your understanding and response.

   With best regards,

   Christos Frangopoulos
