      An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth Experience is a wonderful thing It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again  Red sky at night shepherds delight,red sky in the morning,shepherds warning The best things in life are free No good carpenter does get good wuk bench.
      Don't put all your hypes in one home page. The stick is the surest peacemaker For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. They that walk much in the sun will be tanned at last The devil tempts all, but the idle man tempts the devil
    
    
      You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  Many hands make light work A fool and his money are soon parted.Opportunity makes a thief A Growing Youth Has a Wolf in His Belly. Time waits for nobody
      Bitter pills may have blessed effects To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart  Though the wound be healed, a scar remains  God is Always on the Side of the Big Battalions A gossips mouth is the devils postbag. 
    
  
  Rain ah fall ah roof yuh put barrel fuh ketch am.There is a skeleton in every cupboard  The looks ah de pudding is not de taste. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  Once in a while, right in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives us a fairy tale Variety is the spice of life Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill! Do as you would be done by An old fox is not easily snared You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds A penny always turns up.
