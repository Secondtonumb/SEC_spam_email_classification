      A chat has nine lives.. Mind your own business Rain, Rain, go away, come back another day Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. . 
    
  
  Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  Yuh gat fuh blow yuh nose where yuh stump yuh toe.	Turtle nah want trouble mek he walk with he house pon he back.
