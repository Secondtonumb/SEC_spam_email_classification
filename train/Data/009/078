Adversity doesnt build character, it reveals it  Beautiful is not what is beautiful, but what one likes  Like the measles, love is most dangerous when it comes late in life
Always the bridesmaid,never the bride  Lear from the past, Live for today Look for tomorrow, take a nap this afternoon Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today
