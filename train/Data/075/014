Dear Sir/Madam,

On behalf of a international company, I am trying to find an expert with knowledge about: 
Fat reducing additives, media, technologies, or processes. 

If you feel that you got something to offer our client please reply this mail and we will get in contact with you as soon as possible. We would like to know your suggestion and thoughts for a solution and references.

Please find the project description below :

Our member, an international and important producer of food seeks contact to expert with knowledge about fat reducing additives, media, technologies, or processes. The enterprise produces and distributes a number of products under the collective designation of "convenience food".

It is the enterprise's desire to considerably reduce the fat absorption during the deep frying, or to completely avoid it without loss of the product's properties.


The enterprise has focus on the sub-processes:
v    Raw material: Adjustment/change of ingredients, additives and recipes
v    Media: Use of other or new frying media
v    Technology: Use of alternative browning and frying technologies
v    Process:Adjustment/change of the production process

We know this about the enterprise's products:
v    The product consists of several layers of dough
v    The product may vary in size and weight: Up to: 200 x 50 x 50 mm, 250 grams
v    The product contains a certain amount of water prior to frying in the oil
v    The product is fried to make it crisp and brown on all 25 sides
v    The product is frozen and is to be prepared by the consumer in an oven or on a frying pan

The enterprise has the following requirements to the process:
v    The production process price should not increase significantly compared to the current price
v    Adjustments in the production process should not result in a decrease of the general quality of the product
v    The appearance of the finished product shall be crisp, "dry" and appetizing
v    The finished product shall have a golden brown surface on all 25 sides

The enterprise is prepared to allow for several adjustments in the production process of a given solution to achieve the desired reduction in the fat absorption of the product.

The enterprise is open to all relevant suggestions that may bring them closer to their goal, and therefore they are interested in cooperating with experts with knowledge about additives, frying media, production technologies and methods. Existing and known solutions are of particular interest to the enterprise.

Deadline for this request is 21. August 2006
