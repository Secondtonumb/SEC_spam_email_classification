Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  Rain before seven, fine before eleven

      Caught between a rock and a hard place. A scalded cat fears cold water. When you want fuh swim river yuh gat fuh plunge inside fuss. Strike while the iron is hot
      A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  Every flow hath its ebb Great starts make great finishes. A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.  Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all 
    
    
      A guilty conscience needs no accuser. Nah all who guh a church house ah guh fuh pray. Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give Better bend than break
      Its only rock n roll but I like it Better do it than wish it done Better to aim high and miss, than to aim low and reach target! Fish and cast-net nah friend. While there is life there is hope He who knows better has never tried it Some pork-knockers does only clear track fuh monkey run race. Wedey makes the world go around 
    
  
  An old Ox makes a straight furrow My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil.A good mate is the road map for the spaghetti junction of life. He who pays the piper calls the tune  There is no such thing as a free lunch Second place is first loser A good mate is the road map for the spaghetti junction of life. All cassava get same skin but all nah taste same way. Death is the great leveller There is a time to speak and a time to be silent He who pays the piper calls the tune  Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.
