In this e-news:

1. Deep Exploration 4.0 released
2. Archvision Discovery Viewer for SketchUp
3. SketchUp 2D experiment

1. Deep Exploration 4.0 Standard and CAD Editions have been released. I find Deep Exploration to be a very useful program for converting, viewing, rendering, and animating a huge range of computer graphic and CAD file formats.

On the face of it, Deep Exploration resembles a viewer but it goes much further than that.  Right Hemisphere, the maker, calls it Product Graphic Management (PGM).  That means that you can use the Explorer like interface to manage, view, add photo-realistic renderings, animate and convert to a wide range of publishing formats like PDF, HTML, Flash and much more.  The standard version is $129.  The CAD Edition which supports SolidWorks, Inventor, SolidEdge, CATIA, Pro/E, SDRC, and UGS is currently $999.00.

2. Archvision Discovery Viewer for SketchUp.

Archvision Discovery Viewer is a great tool for displaying SketchUp models directly in PowerPoint, Word and on your web page.  OhYeahCAD is not selling this product but we just want to let SketchUp users about it.

3. 2D SketchUp "experiment"

Are you using SketchUp?  Do you wish there was a utility that would convert 3D SketchUp models into 2D drawings?  If you have some ideas and suggestions, read about Cadalog, Inc.'s proposal to build a 2D SketchUp product.  http://syl.262kkcb5v.com/su2d/.
