      Daddies know best Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg Danger can never be overcome without taking risks 
      A fool will laugh when he is drowning. as strong as love
    
    
      Two wrongs do not make a right All good things come to those who wait.Don't mind how bird vex, it can't vex with tree.
      For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down A spy with flatulence will always blow his cover. A journey of a thousand sites begins with a single click. 
    
  
  A hedge between keeps friendship green. The geek shall inherit the earth.Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me Life is like a drawing pin - sharp at one end, and flat at the other The eyes speak as much as the mouth Things are not always what they seem. Borrowed Garments Never Fit Well He who does not honour his wife dishonours himself Every family has a skeleton in the cupboard A fair exchange is no robbery.
