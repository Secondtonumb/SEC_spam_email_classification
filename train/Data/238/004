I`m one of the foreign students in your class, computer organization. I just want to express my sincere confession for my unappreciated manners during your class lectures, (you know who I am). I want you to appreciate that I didnt realize that eating in class is  very rude to the teacher and one of the unaccepted behavior in the asian countries. I`m terribly sorry for the terrible behavior I have done during your class lecture Please do forgive me. I will do my best from now on. Thank you very much for your understanding and hopefully to hear from you again! If there are anything that you think it might help me do better in your class, please do inform me in advance.
   
  Thanks again!
   
  Sincerely yours,
  Wendell Setham
