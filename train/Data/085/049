Business Description: VISION ENERGY GROUP (Other OTC: 5q3g.67 - News) Vision Energy Group, Inc., a development stage company, owns a technology to generate clean power from pressure letdown at the let down control valves in high pressure natural gas transmission lines. This let down recovery system utilizes a waste heat source in combination with let down expansion turbine. The company was founded in 2002 and is based in Marina Del Rey, California.

Overview:

Thousands of small, inexpensive, scattered and environmentally-friendly sources of energy can now be harvested profitably by using Vision Energy.s (VEG) proven cryogenic and pressure let down technologies to capture otherwise wasted sources of power. Our mini-plants are geared either to electrical generation from natural gas pipeline pressures or the manufacture of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from landfill emissions or "stranded" natural gas sources. In both cases sites are close to attractive markets and offer energy at sharply reduced rates. Capital investment for reliable energy can be reduced by more than ten-fold by a mini-plant while also lowering operating costs.


Technology Opportunity:

Since the deregulation of the energy sector the industry has been changed in many ways. Vision Energy has the opportunity to capitalize on the two major expenses which the industry is saddled with, the expense of the extensive power grid (distributing the power) and the inefficiencies in the outdated technology in use. The technologies the industry has employed are outdated and put into service at a time which is very different from the deregulated industry of today.

Vision Energy plans to focus on major gas consumers/electricity producers, who have much to gain from utilizing our technologies and solutions. Our solutions offer on-site production or supplementation of power therefore eliminating the extra cost of transporting the j8ye50t4th9.d84 improvements in technology used to capture extra energy will have a direct relationship to the cost, availability, and the environmental impact of the industry.


WATCH THIS S T O C K GO HIGHER AND HIGHER



-----------------------
Rough as a cob. Sow dry and set wet. Save it for a rainy day.   As uneasy as a cat near water.   The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   Sour as a green apple.   Walking on cloud nine. The scythe ran into a stone. To rule the mountains is to rule the river.   A rolling stone gathers no moss. She's a mother hen.   We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Salt of the Earth. You say potayto, I say potahto. Raking in the dough. Sow much, reap much; sow little, reap little. Seed money.

They're like two peas in a pod.  A rose is a rose is a rose. A stick in the mud.   The sun will shine into our yard to.   Turn over a new leaf. Ugly as a mud fence. Walking on cloud nine. Spring rain, Fall gold. That's a real stem winder.   Treat him like dirt. Sow much, reap much; sow little, reap little. When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Thick as a brick.   Your barking up the wrong tree. When we love - we grow.  As uneasy as a cat near water.
