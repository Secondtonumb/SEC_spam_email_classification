However, this                 is set to change, with around 60% of revenue growth forecast to                 come from biologic products (therapeutic proteins and monoclonal                 antibodies): by 2010, annual sales of biologics will have increased                 by $26bn, compared to a $13bn increase for small molecules.              This                 report analyzes the revenue performance of the four main drug                 technology types with respect to product, therapy area and company.                 Wedoclonal antibodies will be the fastest growing product type                 out to 2010, recording a CAGR of 26.2%, equal to an absolute annual                 sales increase of $18bn. This revenue analysis is developed into                 an integrated strategic framework that identifies the key competitive                 forces shaping the relative fortunes of the four product classes,                 such as exposure to generic competition, access to new product                 suppliers and health system bargaining power.
