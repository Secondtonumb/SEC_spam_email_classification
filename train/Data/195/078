I urge you to respond to this Notice immediately. Why?

As the PHASE CHART at right demonstrates, the majority of all Prize Numbers offered for this Giveaway are 

projected to be ineligible to win because of failure to respond on time. In fact, as many as 60% of these numbers are likely to be disqualified. This is advantageous to you because ...
									
								
...you,
														
														will be issued a prize number that is fully 

qualified to win a guaranteed $1,OOO,4a9.jb prize. 


								
								Your STATUS REPORT shows you are still very much 

in the game. You can still guarantee that your 

entry will make it in to PHASE 25 WINNER SELECTION PROCESSING if you submit an entry now. 
Remember, the majority of Prize Numbers are expected to be ineligible -- but not the one you'll receive if you 

respond by the deadline
Just think about the thrill. If you are selected the winner, Publishers Clearing House will make sure the "Big 

Check" for $1,OOO,OOO is made out in your name and delivered directly to to your address.
But first things first. We must receive the $1,000,000.00 Official Entry Affidavit by the 

deadine. If we don't hear from you by this date, you will forfeit any prize associated with the prize number you would 

have received by entering through this Bulletin, even if it is identified as the winner. 
Please don't disregard this email -- you may forget to respond on time. I urge you to take the few minutes it 

takes to complete your Official Entry 

Form.
The process we will use to select the winner will begin before you know it, so I must emphasize the importance of entering now. There's no thrill like winning -- so 

please respond at once.
										
									
Wishing you all the best,
											
Todd Sloane 
											
 Senior Vice President
