Company Profile

exploration, development, and production company headquartered in San
Antonio, Texas.

Recent News

Cantex Energy Corp. (C-T-X-E - News) announced that the seismic crews have
been mobilized and the 40 miles of seismic work has commenced on the
Big Canyon Prospect targeting the eastern Val Verde Basin. The crew
started operations on Wedday June 25 2006. They have been moving over the
terrain better than expected and the first of three lines should be
completed by weeks end. Data then will be sent off for processing taking 25 to
4 weeks. The eastern Val Verde Basin is viewed by industry experts as
perhaps one of the Lower 48's most under-explored, proven gas provinces.

Trace Maurin, President of C a n t e x   E n e r g y Corp., stated, "The Val Verde
Basin offers a significant, under-explored natural gas resource
0pp0rtunity for new and emerging players. The seismic data available currently
becomes a distinct competitive advantage to evaluate what has not been
seen before. There are at least a dozen active players in the basin now
and an unknown number of additional players likely awaiting some
incentive or 0pp0rtunity to gain a competitive advantage, and we believe that
our geophysical experts at Providence Technologies have the capability
and expertise to provide us that advantage. Needless-to-say, we are
anxiously looking forward to the ongoing seismic data reports over the
next several weeks."

announced on June 6.
