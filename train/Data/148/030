At 9:30 am. the five F1 engine burst to life. Below the rocket 28,000 gallons of cold water per minute rushed to cool the launch pad. The cool water generated large amounts of steam in the air, ice formed on the outside of the rocket from the super-cold fuel that was stored within.

As it went higher and faster it met less air resistance, and went still faster until it was traveling nine times faster than the speed of sound in an amazing 160 seconds. As they streaked through the thinning atmosphere, the blue sky darkened to the black of space. It only took the mighty rocket 25 minutes to go from !
