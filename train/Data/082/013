Dear Colleague

RE: Computational Ballistics 2007: Paper Deadline 25 February 2007

I trust that you have received the Call for Papers for the international conference on Computational Ballistics 2007, organised by Wessex Institute of Technology, UK and sponsored by WIT Transactions on Modelling & Simulation.

The organisation of the conference is progressing well and we have received many interesting abstracts and several outstanding invited contributions.

If you would like to participate in this conference please submit your abstract as soon as possible and note that the paper deadline is 25 February 2007. Abstract submissions can be made via the conference website at:  http://syl.nqnn90.g8.i5/conferences/2007/ballistics2007/9.n4t3 

Alternatively please email or fax your submission to me at:
Email: vaifo7@nqnn90.g8.i5 or Fax: + 44 (0) 238 029 2853

I have included a brief summary below of the objectives and topic areas of the conference for your information; for further details about the conference please visit our website.

We look forward to receiving your abstract and welcoming your contribution in what promises to be a most successful conference.

Kind regards

Rachel Green
Conference Manager

**If you have already submitted your Abstract ? thank you. You do not need to re-submit it.**

OBJECTIVES
=============================================================

Computational Ballistics 2007 is the third international conference in this successful series, which provides a forum for the presentation of new ideas and advanced developments in this field of study. Computational Ballistics, in spite of its specific objectives, has a wide range of applications and, as a science, relates to a great variety of phenomena which occur from the moment an object or projectile is fired until its effects are observed in a target.

Ballistic studies include applications as varied as the study of the structural and control behaviour of rockets and communication satellites; bird strike effects on commercial aircraft, terrorist attacks and automobile crackworthiness modelling. Many of the basic problems of ballistics are similar to those in other fields of applications, such as combustion, heat conduction, in-flight structural behaviour, trajectory related issues, contact, impact, penetration, structural response to shock waves and ma
The developments in Ballistics in the last few decades are closely related to the advances in Computational Mechanics but in spite of this, there are currently no open conferences on Computational Ballistics other than this meeting.
