Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi . PK - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and 1www02yr4mz8.e80rh1 Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

Water doesn't run uphill.   Say it with flowers.   That's water under the bridge. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.   She has a green thumb. Plant kindness and gather love.   Sour as a green apple.   Sour as a green apple.   A thorn in my side.   Say it with flowers.   What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Play a harp before a cow. She has a green thumb. Watered down.

The season of goodwill.   Plain as water. Up a tree. Putting it in a nutshell.   Where man is not nature is barren. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Survival of the fittest.   Walking on water. The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees. Walking on water. Some like carrots others like cabbage. Play a harp before a cow. Your name is mud.  Stone cold sober.   Some like carrots others like cabbage.
