      What you see in yourself is what you see in the world Who feels guilty, feels responsible The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait Only fools and horses work 
      History repeats itself Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble  Work is the curse of the drinking classes
    
    
      Lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Better do it than wish it doneTo receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree
      Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit. Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. An ant may well destroy a whole dam  Fish ah play ah sea, he nah know watah ah boil fuh am. Better to remain silent and appear a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt  
    
  
  Great minds think alike, simple minds cant think of anything differentTo receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. All lay loads on a willing horse! Never look a gift horse in the mouth A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men. Turtle can't walk if he nah push he head outa he shell. When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern  A cat may look at a king.
