  ENTREPRENUERS CLIMB THEIR OWN MOUNTAINS
  

INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEUR INSTITUTE

Join us and we will help you build and climb your own mountain.
OUR PROGRAM
The International Entrepreneur Institute (IEI) offers a two-year advanced
  entrepreneur program that teaches its students how to become successful entrepreneurs
  in any industry. IEI provides its students with the knowledge and mentor relationships
  that prepares them to effectively compete in today's business world. Students
  are taught by successful entrepreneurs from the USA and many foreign countries.
LEARNING REAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
IEI teaches its students entrepreneurial reality: How companies are really
  managed, how to handle the daily problems every entrepreneur faces, marketing
  techniques that work, how to raise capital, how to deal with banks, the right
  employees to hire, the employees to fire and how to build a team of consulting
  experts in different fields that help make a company successful.
INVESTMENT CAPITAL
Raising venture capital for any company is extremely difficult without the
  proper knowledge, a world class investment package and the right connections.
  IEI teaches its students how to raise capital and introduces its graduate students
  to venture capital companies and individual investors. IEI is also structuring
  its own investment fund that will be available to finance a student's new company.
CONTINUED SUPPORT
IEI provides continued support after graduation. Students are not going to learn
  it all in two years. IEI pledges continued consulting to its students
  to help them reach their goals. IEI also has seminars scheduled several times
  a year plus a three day annual convention with recognized entrepreneur speakers.
ENTREPRENEUR BENEFITS
IEI students learn the benefits of becoming an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs
  have unlimited income potential. They have flexible working hours, they gain
  independence and they make the final decisions that determine their own destiny.
