      The young man thinks the old mans stupid but the old man KNOWS the young man is If there were no lossers there could be no winners  You cannot make bricks without straw  Look good, feel good
      Adversity Makes Strange Bedfellows No good carpenter does get good wuk bench. Ignorance is bliss Merry Nights Make Sorry Days Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. As is the gardener, so is the garden 
    
    
      A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness. The last drop makes the cup run overMan cannot live on bread alone A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise
      A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom See Naples and die All things come to those who wait 
    
  
  Do right and fear no man Zeal without knowledge is the sister of folly One man money mek too much man cry. When yuh play out all yuh trump cards yuh gat to lose till game done. Vex nah gat plaster fuh passion. Fair exchange is no robbery  The darkest hour is just before dawn There is no time like the present Every Ass Loves to Hear Himself Bray Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves
