Lil ah sick, big a get better. 

  Distance makes the heart grow fonder He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian The young man thinks the old mans stupid but the old man KNOWS the young man is There is a time and a place for everything Those who cast the votes decide nothing Those who count the votes decide everything  Nothing that is worth knowing can be taughtOpportunity seldom knocks twice. A soft answer turneth away wrath. 
  There is no such thing as a free lunch Variety is the spice of life Art has no enemy but ignorance A Growing Youth Has a Wolf in His Belly. Two wrongs do not make a rightA man is judged by his deeds, not by his words. The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. Faint heart never won fair lady He who has once burnt his mouth always blows his soup Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. 
  Old fish and young flesh feed men best The young man thinks the old mans stupid but the old man KNOWS the young man is Everything must have a beginning Youth nah ah weary but he ah fall down. Work expands so as to fill the time availableWe never know the worth of water till the well is dry  Nothing is certain but death and taxes People living in glass houses should not!. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. When alone, we have our thoughts to watch, in our families, our tempers and in society our tongues 
  Common fame is seldom to blame Pain is so close to pleasureA friend to all is a friend to none.  A place for everything and everything in its place. Oh, what a tangled Web site we weave when first we practice. Baby who ah cry ah house and ah door ah same thing. Fools and madmen speak the truth What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. Youth and Old Age Will Never Agree Fear lends wingsWe never know the worth of water till the well is dry  
  Know which side your bread is buttered  When man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am. A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept. If trousers say massah teef, yuh can't doubt am. C:\ is the root of all directories. Smile and the world smiles with you, snore and you sleep alone An eye for an eye, a tooth for a toothFor jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. Think before you speak If anything can go wrong, it will 
  He who dares wins A whistling women and a crowing hen are neither fit for God or men. Night is the Mother of Counsel Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves A Fool Oct Give a Wise Man Counsel. Murder will out There is no such thing as a free lunch One years seeding means seven years weeding 
  If yuh eye nah see, yuh mouth nah must talk. A cold bitter Christmas, a fat churchyard. A celebrity is someone who works hard all his life to become known and then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognized. He Lives Long Who Lives Well Love is blind Charity covers a multitude of sins Take a hair of the dog that bit you Old friends and wine are best  Oh, what a tangled Web site we weave when first we practice. To whom God gives, to him also the people give  True blue will never stain 
  Many are called but few are chosen
