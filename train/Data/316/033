  VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 9, 2006--Falcon Energy, Inc. 
  (Pinnk Sheeets:2wv2.67 - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired 
  the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region 
  of Wedgolia. Management felt that the opportunity presented by these properties 
  was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource 
  company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant 
  Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties. 
  Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held 
  include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well 
  as Fluorite and Uranium.
  
  Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount Westlock property 
  in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and 
  investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since the well 
  was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that 
  time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed over 
  10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range. 
  The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue 
  for the company and its shareholders.
  
  Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed addition of 
  its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding 
  the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will

  A stumble may prevent a fall. To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him God helps those who help themselves You cant buy love  The early bird catches the worm The last drop makes the cup run over A friend to all is a friend to none.  Two fools in a house are too manyA new broom sweeps clean. 
  A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept. A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness. The King can make a knight, but not a gentleman  Baby who ah cry ah house and ah door ah same thing. Zeal without knowledge is the sister of folly For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD.When you want fuh swim river yuh gat fuh plunge inside fuss. Once bitten twice shy  From the sweetest wine the tartest vinegar 
  Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs Opportunities always look bigger going than coming  There's a light at the end of the tunnel. All good things must come to an end.
