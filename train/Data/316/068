Cat foot soft but he ah scratch bad. 

  If you wish to be loved, love Speak softly and carry a cellular phone. The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than bothBetter to be alone than in bad company  
  After dark all cats are leopards After a storm comes a calm. Rained on ground hardens (Japanese Proverb) Rats desert a sinking ship Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.Hasty climbers have sudden falls The squeaky wheel gets the grease. The truth will out Take your time and time will take you  
  Laughter is the closest distance between two people The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak The early bird catches the worm, but it is the early worm that gets caught.Might is right Two's company, three's.. the musketeers. To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. Don't put all your hypes in one home page. The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him 
  Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside A stitch in time saves nine. Work expands so as to fill the time available Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men. There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem  The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth Fine feathers make fine birds Imagination is the highest kite you can flyWalls have ears  as soft as velvet 
  Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside  Old friends and wine are best  What goes up must come down A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. Where there's a will, there's a relative. Everything must have a beginning The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.You only live once An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth Unkissed, unkind 
  Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house. A Fool Oct Give a Wise Man Counsel. A man that breaks his word bids other be false to him. Tomorrow never comesLear from the past, Live for today Look for tomorrow, take a nap this afternoon When the student is ready, the master will appear  When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead. A tree never hits an automobile except in self defense. It is nice to be important but it is more important to be nice 
  Every cloud has a silver lining Things that come to those who wait may be things left by those who got there first  You never know what you can do until you try An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief. Laughter is the best medicine. Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled  Don't count your chickens before they're hatched . Give and spend and God will send A stumble may prevent a fall. The nearer to the church, the farther from God The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak 
  Windows will never cease.
