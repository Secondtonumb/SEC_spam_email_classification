      So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Take a hair of the dog that bit you One foolish sheep will lead the flock

      Windows will never cease.For every action, there is an equal and opposite government program.  A slip of the tongue is no fault of the mind and he who laughs is very unkind.
      You cannot make bricks without straw  He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty Cuss when yuh ah guh, nah wheh yuh ah come out. Necessity is the mother of invention. But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 
    
  
  Be a good sport - wherever you go  If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. .A friend in need is a friend indeed. He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day A fool and his money are soon parted.

You cannot get blood from a stone Make hay while the sun shines Experience is the best teacher
