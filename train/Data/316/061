      The best of men are but men at best The bigger the better.
      Too many cooks spoil the broth In the coldest flint there is hot fire A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels.
    
     
      The pot calls the kettle black. Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded.Needs must when the devil drives
      My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance.  When in Rome, do as the Romans do Daddies know best A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. 
    
  
  Coin a phraseCharity covers a multitude of sins Well done is better than well said A place for everything and everything in its place. Happy the bride who.. gets all the presents. A squirrel is just a rat with good PR. Better to be alone than in bad company  His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. Yuh can't drink mauby and belch beer.
