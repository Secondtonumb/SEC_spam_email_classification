Although I know that a transaction of this magnitude might make anyone apprehensive, I would like to assure you that i am sending you this mail with the best of intensions.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be claimed by an indigene nor approved to a local bank here considering the fact that the rightful owner of the account is a foreigner. So a foreigner is needed to act as the next of kin to this account to avoid raising an eye brow.
