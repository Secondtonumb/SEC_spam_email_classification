Dear Colleagues:

Recently, the Russian Ministry of Culture produced a collection of the Russian Classical Music. It consists of 500 CDs and it includes many unique works which were rarely performed. 

All the recordings are of Russian performers and the quality of the CDs is very high. Each CD has its own plastic case and a printed brochure in English with a detailed description of the contents. This collection is especially made for distribution abroad, therefore the price is 70% lower, at 2.- US$ per CD.

In case if you are interested in ordering this collection, please let us know at dehbuousy@q1nns5si.p4 

You can buy the whole collection for 1190.- US dollars, including the shipping charges to your country.

Yours sincerely,

r. Sergey Afanasiev,
Zakazchik Foundation.
Russian Federation.
