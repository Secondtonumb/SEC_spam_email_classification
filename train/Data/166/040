Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the 0pp0rtunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant F A L C O N  E N E R G Y  I N C. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

If you miss F_C_Y_I now you WILL regret it.

-----------------------
Sick as a dog.   A rolling stone gathers no moss. Sow dry and set wet. Survival of the fittest.   This is for the birds.   Pull it up by the roots. Walking on thin ice. She's a mother hen.   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. You say potayto, I say potahto. As uneasy as a cat near water.   Water doesn't run uphill.   Too little too late.   Slow as molasses in January. Your in hot water. What on earth? As uneasy as a cat near water.   Root it out. Putting the cart before the horse.

When pigs fly.  Your barking up the wrong tree. A thorn in my side.   Sweet as apple pie.   There is always next year.   You feel like a fish out of water. Walking on thin ice. Spaceship earth.   Stop, look and listen. That's water under the bridge. You have to separate the chaff from the wheat. Tall as a tree.   Putting it in a nutshell.   Your name is mud.  What goes down usually comes up.  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Shit happens.   Still water runs dirty and deep.   Stir up an ant's nest.
