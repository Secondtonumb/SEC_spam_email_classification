URGENT ASSISTANCE 
  Attn: Wedend, 
  
I am Bunor Charles Taylor, the third son of formal President Charles Taylor of Liberia on Wedrsday 29th march 2006 my father was extradited from Nigeria to his home country Liberia after he was caught trying to escape custody - ending his exile of nearly three years in Nigeria. Presently my father is facing 25 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over his alleged role in the brutal civil war in Sierra Leone where he is accused of backing rebels, he is accused of selling diamonds and buying weapons for the Revolutionary United Front rebels, but before his attempt escape he called me and inform me about the sum of twenty million five hundred thousand united state dollars ($20.5m) deposited with a security company abroad and hand over the documents to me. 
  Now, I want to set up a business overseas with the fund and I decided to contact you to help me claim the money as my family business associate and also set up a profitable business in your country, but would not want my name or family name to be used. 
  
I am prepared to give you 20% of the total sum if you can assist me in claiming this fund from the security volt where my father (President Charles Taylor) deposited this fund before his arrest. Please, do contact me immediately for us to discuss. As soon as I hear from you, and confirm your assistance every documents regarding to the claiming of this fund will be handed over to you as the family?s foreign business associate, also I want you to keep this transaction secret because of the present position of my father as the government of Liberia has started frozen my fathers banks account and properties. 
  
Best regards 
  Bunor Charles Taylor.
