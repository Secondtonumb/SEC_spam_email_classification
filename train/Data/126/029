      Know what to expect before you connect. Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity  Wasteful man money ah guh like butter in de sun.
      Lil ah sick, big a get better. Seven years nah too much fuh wash speck off ah bird neck. He who laughs last, thinks the slowest!
    
    
      God help the poor, for the rich can help themselves Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it  Life is just a bowl of cherries.
      Love is the strangest thing Fine words butter no parsnips  Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to use the Net and he won't bother you for weeks. 
    
  
  The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it He who laughs last laughs longestHe who drinks Australian Thinks Australian If life deals you lemons make lemonade  Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you A guilty conscience needs no accuser.  A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their meat. Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl
