Age is a very high price to pay for maturity Happy the bride who.. gets all the presents.

      There is a time to speak and a time to be silent Every cloud has a silver lining They that walk much in the sun will be tanned at last Divide and rule
      We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. People living in glass houses should not pelt stones. The pen is mightier than the sword.
    
    
      Like flogging a dead horse Hungry nah know bam-by.Beauty without virtue is a flower without perfume He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian
      Better to remain silent and appear a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt  A leopard cannot change its spots. Charity begins at home When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  The Absent are Always Wrong 
    
  
  Wise men think alike. Vex nah gat plaster fuh passion.Things can only get better Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy  Yuh tel tara and tara tell tara. Chaste makes waste. Every cloud has a silver lining Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all  Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth
