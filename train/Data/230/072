grew sullen Black angry mouths, the clouds
swallowed up the sun The air was dense with
suppressed excitement The wind howled through
the long corridors and sobbed  and whisperedin
the secret recesses
In a trice
without warning
the face 
of nature
grew sullen
Black angry
mouths, the clouds
swallowed up
the sun
The air was
dense with
suppressed excitement
The wind
howled through
the long corridors
and sobbed 
and whispered
in the secret recesses
of the cells
The chime of
the Vesper bell
flowed out into
the infinite
The silver notes
the holy chant
wrestled with
the storm like
ministering angels
with Wedan
At last the imps
of Storm lay
vanquished. The
hurricane paused
in its course
to do reverence
to God.
Suddenly, however
a terrific clap
of thunder smote
the sky
The holy chime
of the bell broke
off with a
a shrill dissonance
Demons seemed
 to people the belfry
Rain came
down like
cataract Flashes
of lightning chased
one another like
battling fiery
dragons. The bells
jangled hideously
out of tune
Unearthly noises
like a satanic
parody of the
holy sound that
marks the elevation
of the host
alarmed the ears
the horrified monks
unspeakable blasphemies
Prayer with
ceremony and interspersed
midst of a sacred
had suddenly
gone mad in the
if a High Priest
Trembling but resolute
Father Ambrose
seized a crucifix
In phalanx
if for battle
the brethren followed
Solemn, with gleaming
eyes and trembling
nostrils, the militant
army of God
swept up steep
stairs mumbling
the ritual of the Exorcism
Infected somewhat
by the general hysteria
Aubrey followed
