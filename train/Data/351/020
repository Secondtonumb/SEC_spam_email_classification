Back to the unlucky boy, he was seriously ill for a week. His 
heart was dead because he knew it was impossilbe for
him to compete with that gentleman in the near future. 
He didn't want to do anything. He skipped classes. He locked
himself in his room. If he was ever at the lab, he would stare
at the computer screen all day with a foolish idea that he might 
get some surprise email from her. If only she said hello, he'd 
like to forget all the past and start all over again. Yeah, 
he hated her, but the truth is, he still loved her, deeply. How 
could he forget a person so important in his life for two and a 
half years? He wished that there could be a huge disaster in 
1999 as predicted in some popular book so that he could be 
destroyed together with the world.

Well, whatever tragedy happens in the world, the earth still 
revolves around the sun. It's no use to bury yourself in the 
past. Forturnately, my friend finally realized it. Of course,
it didn't happen in one or two days. Only time can heal 
everything, and it took a long while, maybe 3 months, maybe 
half a year. What keeps him going was one strong belief in
his mind: If his GF destroyed their love, at least she 
could not destroy him, his life and his future! He may never
be as rich as that gentleman, but he can be himself, a person
who can still appreciate the wonder of the world even it 
is full of betrayal, deceit and evil.
