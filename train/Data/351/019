So the girl went to her dream university. The guy stayed in the
small town while also dreaming about the bright future. He really 
worked hard. He wish to find a job in a place nearby. His major was
CS, so there should be no big problem. 

The days went on. They were seperate for 3 months. They wrote emails
and called over the phone. But by and by, the boy noticed something wrong.
The girl was not so eager to reply his letters any more. and sth.
worse, although he called the girl almost every day(he spent two
hundred dollars in calling every month), the girl seemed
not interested in it. The more he called, the more she got bored.
Sometime, she could sleep on the other side of the line. In the email,
she told him that the life there was really busy  and 
she might not have enought time to reply his emails and chat over the
phone. 

The guy was very afraid. He didn't know what happened, but he knew he must
do sth. Then he flied to her city during Christmas. He was so eager
to see her. She was his life! Without her, his dream would be nothing!
