Well, I'm pretty tired and relaxed after keying in the five parts 
of the story. Most are true while some are just my own imagination. 

I hope my story is a little different from others. It is 
not pure tragedy, nor pure comedy. It depends on how you 
percieve it. I also believe that life is like this,
no absolute tragedy, no absolute comedy. It depends on how
you deal with it. Tragedy can become comedy, and vice versa,

Have you guys ever read "The Great Gatsby"?

Is Gatsby great? In some ways he is, you have to admire
a person who lives his whole life devoting himself to his passion and
never getting sidetracked. But you also have to realize that some
things are foolish to live a dream upon, because nothing ever stays
the same. Things change and when you reach a goal you realize it wasn't
what you remember. Nothing in life is sadder than this. What
will I do in Gatsby's shoes? I don't know. The attempt to capture
the American dream is central to this novel. For Jay Gatsby, his
American dream is not material possessions, although it may seem
that way. He only comes into riches so that he can fulfill his true
American Dream, Daisy, the one he loves. Gatsby doesn't rest until
his American Dream is finally fulfilled, or broken. The end of the
is pretty sad. However, the idea of the American Dream
still holds true in today's time, be it wealth, love or fame. And
one thing never changes: everyone desires something in life, and
everyone, somehow, strives to get it.

Let me conclude the story with some sentence I like best.

" Anyone could be unhappy; it took no courage or effort. But true
achievement lay in struggling to be happy. "

Finally, please excuse me for using English cause I have no chinese 
O.S. at hand that support input. Also, I'd like to practice my
English writing skills. After all, we can't always use chinese 
in the American society. 

Thank you for reading. Good night and have a good dream!
