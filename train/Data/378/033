Non-Intrusive Enterprise Application Integration to Improve Information Flow
http://4g.b2102zgk.com/93.n4t3?rtr=on&s=1,2jks,1,j9wg,91l,935f,2glk

-------------------------------------------------------------
Businesses large and small rely on the availability of information in order to compete.
To improve their information supply chain, many organizations have embarked on
traditional enterprise application integration (EAI) projects that promise the seamless
integration of systems within the enterprise. 

EAI projects are notoriously difficult to deliver on time and within the budget, however.
They require the work and experience of vendors, which cost money, and employees, some of
whom may no longer be available. 

An opportunity exists for businesses to adopt non-intrusive methods of integration,
saving both time and money while also improving the flow of information. These methods
focus on adding siphons to extract information from existing streams of data in report
queues. Security and audit concerns are easily addressed, existing business rules are
preserved, and the organization can focus on its business needs instead of its
technology. 

Join software and IT management expert George Spafford to discuss the challenges of
traditional EAI projects and how enterprises can streamline their information supply
chain without taking on such a costly and time-consuming process.

Joining George will be Patrick Smith of Xenos, who will discuss how technology from Xenos
can be used to repurpose existing data assets so companies can compete in new markets or
respond to rapidly changing conditions. Using data capture, transform, and transport
capabilities deployed as services on the enterprise network, Xenos allows organizations
to change everything without changing everything.
