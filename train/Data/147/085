Some individuals have described a living will as a means of legally
stating that they do not wish to be maintained in a vegetative state
where there is no reasonable and probable hope of their recovery.

A living will enables the individual to make this decision for himself
or herself and eliminates the burdens, financial and moral, that are
otherwise thrust upon a family or loved ones at a critical time when
they may be emotionally unprepared to handle such decisions.
