	and untouched. I have enough to last me my time, said Bilbo,
when they
	had dug it up. You had better take this, Gandalf. I daresay you
can
	find a use for it.
	Indeed I can! said the wizard. But share and share alike! You
may
	find you have more needs than you expect.
	So they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who
were
	not at all pleased about it. After that their going was slower,
for most
	of the time they walked. But the land was green and there was
much grass
	through which the hobbit strolled along contentedly. He mopped
his face
	with a red silk handkerchief-no! not a single one of his own had
	survived, he had borrowed this one from Elrond -for now June had
brought
	summer, and the weather was bright and hot again.
	As all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at
last
	when they were in sight of the country where Bilbo had been born
and
	bred, where the shapes of the land and of the trees were as well
known
	to him as his hands and toes. Coming to a rise he could see his
own Hill
