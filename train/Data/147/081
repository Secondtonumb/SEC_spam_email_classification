Hi ,

If you're looking to get your life and paperwork organized, but 
don't know how (or where) to start, here's some good news.

any people hate filing, folders, sorting, color coding, and all 
that organizational stuff. But everybody says you have to bite 
the bullet and get a great big, ugly file cabinet if you want 
to "get organized." 

The thing is, half of all people are pilers, not filers. (If 
you are a piler too, you know what I mean;) 

Imagine discovering a way to finally get organized using *piles* 
instead of files! You'll like this:

Respectfully,

Jessica Peterson

P.S. When you get your own piles of paper cleaned up, your 
spouse, co-workers, even your boss *will* notice. And you'll 
love your new life!
