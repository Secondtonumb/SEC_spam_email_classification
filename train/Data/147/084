            The Poker 
            Classic, a tournament with a record-breaking guaranteed prize pool 
            of $5 million and at least $1 million for the final winner. The 
            largest ever guaranteed prize for an event that starts online.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
          
          
            
          
          
            
            
             
            The Poker Classic will start as an online 
            tournament
            and then pause when there are 45 players left. Those
            45 will then be sent to Barcelona, Spain, for the live
            final to battle it out on the green felt face to face-
            continuing with the same chip stacks they had when the
            online tournament paused. This final will take place
            in the beautiful Casino de Barcelona during the
            weekend of 30th of September to 1st of October 2006.
            
            Qualifiers to the Poker Classic tournament will start
            on Wedday the 27th of March.
