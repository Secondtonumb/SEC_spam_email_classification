Dr.James Peter.
DIRECTOR, ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (N.N.P.C)

ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO,

TRANSFER OF $28,600,000:00 (TWENTY-EIGHT MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS) ONLY.

I got your contact from the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce & Industry. Following this and other investigations resulting in a good recommendation. We have decided to contact you to help us with the legal Transfer of US$28,600,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Six hundred Thousand United States Dollars).

The amount stated above resulted from an over-invoiced contract executed for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C.) for which the contractors have been fully paid. Because this money was part of the overall contract sum amounting to (US$100,000,000:00) that has been completed.

The said amount has remained dormant and floating in our Apex Bank. Therefore, we will raise supplementary documents to enable us transfer into an account that is yet to be nominated. We need a foreign partner, because as civil servants, the code of conduct does not allow us to operate foreign bank accounts. Hence we solicit for your assistance; we are requesting you to provide us with the help for the safekeeping of this money until our arrival in your country to collect our share and decide on investment possibilities of this money.

For your assistance in this transaction, we have unanimously agreed to offer you 27% of this money, 3% will be used in settling any incidental expenses that may arise and the remaining amount will be for us. To enable the prompt transfer of this money, kindly send to us your personal details, contact information & bank details in full where the funds will be remitted for further transfer to any account of your choice.

We look forward to hearing from you and thanking you for your anticipated cooperation and consideration in the above subject matter. Please be informed that we would appreciate the handling of this transaction in a confidential manner. We sincerely advise that you contact us on email to maintain the confidentiality of the business. Sending e-mail will be appreciated.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. James Peter
