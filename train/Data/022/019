Sir,
Compliments of the day!
I got your contact on my private search for a reliable and trusted 
person to
handle a transaction of this nature. I know that the contents of this 
mail
might sound so strange, but I want to assure you that every word of it 
is
true.
I am Brain Smith a Financial Consultant to a deceased Immigrant Mr 
Andreas
Schranner,property magnate who was based in the U.K., who happens to 
be my
client. On the month of July 2000, my client, his wife Maria, their 
daughter
Andrea Eich, her husband Christian, and their children Katharina and
aximilian all died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for 
New York
in their plan for a world cruise,

Since then I have been managing his properties here in the U.K. and 
some
others which he put out for sale. The properties which have long been 
put
out on sale have now been paid for and now the money paid has long 
been
deposited into his local bank account here. I have contacted you to 
assist
in repatriating the money and estate left behind by my client before 
they
get seized or declared unserviceable by his bank.
Particularly, the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of 
his
beneficiary or have the account confisticated within a short period of
xp8a.og late client has an account valued at 25.3 Million United 
States
Dollars Only. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of my 
clients
relatives for some time now and with no one coming forward since my 
client
passed on and with the bank now giving me a deadline, I now seek your
consent to present you as the beneficiary to my deceased client, so 
that the
proceeds of his account valued at 25.3 Million UnitedStates Dollars 
Only can
be paid to you.
This I intend we share amongst ourselves in the ratio of 50% to me and 
40%
for you while the balance 10% we shall use for settling any
miscellaneous expenses that might arise.
I have all the necessary information that can be used to back up any 
Claim
that we may make and I can assure you that you shall be paid this 
amount as
the beneficiary of the funds of my late client. All I require is your 
honest
co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this 
will
be executed under alegitimate arrangement that will protect you from 
any
breach of the law. Trust me as his personal consultant that this is a
risk-free transaction. Please get in touch with me via my confidential
email, and send me the following information:
1)Your full names and address as you want them used in the payment 
documents
