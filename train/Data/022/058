      Coin a phrase As is the gardener, so is the garden  Stir With a Knife, Stir Up Strife
      Revenge is a dish best served cold. Its only rock n roll but I like it
    
    
      A man walks, God places the feet. You do well to believe in God Wedan also believes and trembles Give Neither Counsel Nor Salt till You Are Asked For It The modem is the message.
      Nothing succeeds like success Children should be seen and not heard Look before you leap What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive When yuh play out all yuh trump cards yuh gat to lose till game done. Diligence is the mother of good fortune 
    
  
  When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone A fly will not get into a closed mouth.If yuh eye nah see, yuh mouth nah must talk. A man in love is a fool, and an old man in love is the greatest fool of all. Never speak ill of the dead  Better to be safe than sorry Make hay while the sun shines Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
