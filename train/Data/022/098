      He who plays with fire will get burnt Only knife ah know whah in pumpkin belly.	 Keep your chin up
      Nothing ventured, nothing gained You cant hurry love  He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day The longest rope has an end
    
    
      The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.Time and tide wait for no man. A closed mouth gathers no feet. 
      The first step is the hardest. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. Curiosity killed the cat. Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people  Do not wear out your welcome 
    
  
  All is for the best in the best of the possible worldsAll the world loves a lover Fools rush in where angels fear to tread All good things must come to an end. What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts The longest rope has an end When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead. Do as I say, and not as I do He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian
