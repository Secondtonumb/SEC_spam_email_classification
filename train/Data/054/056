Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery 

  A little of what you fancy does you good.  Many are called but few are chosen Only knife ah know whah in pumpkin belly.	 Happiness is wanting what you have - not having what you want Never choose bedlinen or a wife by candlelight  A worry shared is a worry halved.Its too late to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted 
  The best doctors are Dr Diet, Dr Quiet and Dr Merryman You cannot get blood from a stone The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him Fair without , false within There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem  Abstinence makes the heart go wander. Diamonds cut diamondsAfter a storm comes a calm. Have you ever noticed? anybody going slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac A cat has nine lives. The more the merrier  Every body wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die When yuh buy ah dutty calico yuh gat fuh wear am till it tear. 
  Be first at the feast, and last at the fight Every bird loves to hear himself sing Love is like a fire, it can either warm your heart or burn your house down A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor. Live to the point of tearsThe early bird catches the worm. He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty None so deaf as those who will not hear  When the wine is in, the wit is out  
  Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howlIf the wind will not serve, take to the oars The Devil goes shares in gaming  The modem is the message. The more one knows, the less one believes Wise children have short years In for a penny, in for a pound. To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. Practice makes perfect Virtue is its own rewardAge has no friend but the wrinkles of the mind 
  Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people  As you sow, so shall you reap What you see in yourself is what you see in the world Not to know is bad; not to wish to know is worse  Never judge a book by its cover To thine own self be true If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way. Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing As you sow, so shall you reapBeggars and borrowers cannot be choosers And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. Better bend than break 
  The early worm enjoys a leisurely breakfast  You can't teach an old dog new tricks. The pen is mightier than the sword Once bitten twice shy Look after number one Excess of ceremony shows want of breeding  Cultivate money and you grow rich, Cultivate mind and you raise culture Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea . 
  They Brag Most That Can Do the Least Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Use soft words and hard arguments Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. There will be rubs in the smoothest road United we stand, divided we fall  If cow-man pass wild meat whah mek me must pick up am. Danger can never be overcome without taking risks  The truth will out Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree 
  A cat has nine lives.
