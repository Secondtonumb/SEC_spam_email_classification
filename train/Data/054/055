      A man that breaks his word bids other be false to him. Every cloud has a silver lining Confession is good for the soul
      Although the Wed Oct Shine, Leave Not Thy Cloak at Home Sleep is better than medicine Time and tide wait for no man. The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory  For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.
    
    
      Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel. There is a skeleton in every cupboard  Work expands so as to fill the time availableHe is an ill companion that has a good memory 
      The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones Youth is wasted on the young While there is life there is hope A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men. The modem is the message. 
    
  
  There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise Home is where the heart is When yuh deh in bad luck wet paper self ah cut yuh. A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. You get out of life what you put into it Mouth cut trousers nah ah fit Massa. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? A hedge between keeps friendship green.
