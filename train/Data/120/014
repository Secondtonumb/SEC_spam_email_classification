Creative mentoring in science
Last year, we inaugurated a new award: the Nature/NESTA awards for creative mentoring in science, cosponsored by the UK's National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA). We are pleased to announce that this year Nature will be sponsoring awards for high-achieving mentors in two regions: the United Kingdom and, later this year, Australasia. The UK awards are now open for nominations. The closing date is 19 June.
In each region there will be two prizes awarded: one for a lifetime's achievement in mentoring, and another to an individual in the middle of his or her career. The prizes are intended to celebrate a scientific activity that otherwise tends to get taken for granted.

Chernobyl and the future: Too soon for a final diagnosis p993
Twenty years ago, the nuclear accident at Chernobyl exposed hundreds of thousands of people to radioactive fallout. We still have much to learn about its consequences, argue Dillwyn Williams and Keith Baverstock.

Neuroscience: Spikes too kinky in the cortex? p999
The Hodgkin-Huxley theory that explains the mechanism of how neurons fire forms the cornerstone of computational neuroscience. But something it hasn't predicted is happening in the brain cortex.

Glaciology: Ice-sheet plumbing in Antarctica p1000
It's not easy to work out what is going on beneath four kilometres of ice. But remote imaging has enabled the discovery of the long-distance discharge of water from one subglacial lake to another in Antarctica.

Evolution: Spot on (and off) p1001

Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a neural population p1007
Collective behaviour in neurons in the vertebrate retina is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations, but assume no higher order interactions.

Crystal structure of an Hsp90-nucleotide-p23/Sba1 closed chaperone complex p1013
The structure of full-length Hsp90 in association with an ATP analogue and a co-chaperone details for the first time how ATP binding changes Hsp90's conformation, and how the co-chaperone stabilizes the overall structure so that target proteins can bind.

Polarons and confinement of electronic motion to two dimensions in a layered manganite p1025
An even more extreme version of the 'confinement' effect ? when electron charge motion in layered transition-metal oxides is highly anisotropic, ranging from metallic within the plane of the layers to near insulating in the perpendicular direction ? is reported in a layered manganese oxide.

Climate sensitivity constrained by temperature reconstructions over the past seven centuries p1029
Use of large-ensemble energy balance modelling to simulate temperature response to past solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing suggests a very small probability that climate sensitivity will exceed 25 degrees Celsius.

Rapid discharge connects Antarctic subglacial lakes p1033
Observation of surface elevation changes over 25 months in an area of the East Antarctic ice sheet overlying subglacial lakes suggests a rapid discharge of one lake to at least two other lakes, involving a water volume of 1.8 km3 ? in conflict with previous expectations that subglacial lakes have long residence times and slow circulations.

A Cretaceous terrestrial snake with robust hindlimbs and a sacrum p1037
A new species of fossil snake with robust hindlimbs and a sacral region is likely to be the most primitive snake yet known ? its features indicating a terrestrial, perhaps burrowing origin of snakes, rather than the marine origin that is sometimes suggested.

Evolution of cooperative strategies from first principles p1041
A computer model that lets notional organisms make their own rules as they go along results in a rich ecology of cooperative behaviour never before seen in such simulations, in which cooperative 'starlings' and 'ravens' are added to the expected 'hawks' and 'doves' of game theory.

Enhanced bacterial clearance and sepsis resistance in caspase-12-deficient mice p1064
Caspase-12 directly inhibits caspase-1 and so diminishes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines ? meaning mice without caspase-12 are therefore better equipped to combat bacteria than normal mice and become resistant to peritonitis and septic shock.
