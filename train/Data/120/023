Investment Plan


Please read!

In April 2003, Staff Sergeant Kenneth Buff of the United States Army found US$160 million hidden by fleeing members of the Baath Party led by former dictator Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Later, a search of the area revealed more hidden loot, totaling US$650 million in all! For a detailed account of the money found by the US Soldiers, please click on the following website:

Last week, during a routine archaeological excavation of the area east of Tigris River, I
discovered 2 boxes of the similar kind found by US Army! After careful examination I discovered that it is $100 US Dollars notes totaling USD 7Million which I concealed personally and packaged in one box hidden safely at my place of residence. Indeed, the security situation here is very critical; I would want to move those funds out of the country without hesitation. Therefore the solution is to move this money abroad anxiously as I cannot do it alone; I need foreign help! Can you help me? I do not have any foreign contacts. I will therefore appreciate your help to move this money abroad for investment. In consideration of your help, you will keep US$1.4 million of this money as your share, and keep US$5.6 million in a safe bank account for me, until I will arrive your Country to invest the money.


If you are interested, please reply urgently so that we can conclude the plan to move this money. It will be 100% risk free! You will not be required to travel to Iraq. Rather I can send it to you via diplomatic courier service through special arrangement to your country for you to clear and collect and proceed for subsequent lodgment of the money into your designated account pending my arrival as time can permit me

ay Allah bless you!
