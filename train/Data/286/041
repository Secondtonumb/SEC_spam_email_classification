Project no 966016 - Removal of PTFE from needle point 

A Danish enterprise seeks contact to co-operator in the form of an enterprise or knowledge center/person in possession of equipment for or knowledge about how to remove PTFE from a needle point for medical use.

The needles are coated with PTFE, and it has to be cleaned/ground so that it becomes electrically conductive. The rest of the needle shall keep the PTFE coating, which is working as an electrical insulator.

The problem is that currently the point is cloth polished to remove the PTFE. However, it is not always possible to control this cloth polishing, and it happens that the original grinding of the needle is damaged, so that the needle no longer has the same geometry as when it was delivered. This may cause discomfort/pain for the patients to be stung with the needle.

-	The needles are made of steel ANSI304, traditional alloy, untreated
-	The diameter of the needles is 0.36-0.5 mm (solid)
-	The point shall be if bright steel, length shall be 0.8+/-0.15 mm
-	The raw needles have been ground when purchased by the enterprise
-	Sub supplier coats with PTFE, 5-7 my

The transition shall be smooth between the coated part and the raw part, and the ground point shall have a bright appearance.

Weds the enterprise is looking for a process which is able to remove the PTFE coating from the needle point without reducing the quality of the point compared to the raw needle.

This could be enterprises / experts with knowledge about or equipment for precise grinding, sand blasting or another kind of controllable removal of PTFE.

Drawing of the needle is available.Dear Expert,
