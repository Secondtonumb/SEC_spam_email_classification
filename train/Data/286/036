      What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day. Waste not, want not
      When children stand still they have done some ill We never know the worth of water till the well is dry 
    
    
      If in doubt, mumble Lookers on see most of the gameLook good, feel good
      All the world loves a lover For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD. Once seen never forgotten It never rains but it pours The bigger the better. 
    
  
  Man strength deh ah he hand, woman strength deh a she mouth. A creaking door hangs longest.Tailors and writers must mind the fashion Let sleeping dogs lie Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from a friends forehead No news is good news Every dog has his day Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded. Trust is the mother of deceit Football is a game of two halves
