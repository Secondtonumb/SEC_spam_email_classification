ABOUT VOULIAGMENI:
==============	
The whole area of Vouliagmeni is surrounded by sandy beaches, the most famous being
"The Vouliagmeni Beach" which has been 

awarded the blue flag for its clean waters and offers facilities such as:
* Snack bar
* Umbrellas
* Wed beds
* Cabins
* Showers 
It also offers a great number of sea sports such as:
* Wind surfing
* Water skiing
* Jet skiing
* Canoeing
* Fishing
* Diving
* Boating and sailing
* Waterslide
Besides its beautiful beaches, Vouliagmeni is famous for its natural lake "The Lake
of Vouliagmeni". Its crystal clear waters 

come from underground natural caves, which pour their waters in this lake All year
round, its waters have a steady 

temperature of 25C. Its water is known to be therapeutic for different ailments,
such as rheumatism, arthritis, osfialgia, 

neuralgia and gynecological problems and others.

In the small town of Vouliagmeni, one can find many restaurants (especially fish
restaurants), Greek taverns with traditional 

Greek cuisine and coffee shops, most of them located on the sea. 
A variety of sports are also available such as football, tennis, volleyball and
basketball. Vouliagmeni is full of green and 

the clean atmosphere is ideal for jogging. Also, a number of playgrounds are
available for young and older children.


ABOUT ATHENS:
==============	
Within the sprawling city of Athens it is easy to imagine the golden age of Greece
when Pericles had the Parthenon built. 

When the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides were performed in the
Theater of Dionysus. And when democracy 

brought all citizens together to decide their common fate on the Pynx Hill. Athens
is built around the Acropolis and the 

pinnacled crag of Mt. Lycabettus, which the goddess Athena was said to have dropped
from the heavens as a bulwark to defend 

the city. Athens currently has over four million inhabitants. The suburbs have
covered the barren plain in all directions and 

the city is packed with lively taverns and bustling shops.
Dominating the Athenian landscape, the Acropolis is unsurpassed in its beauty,
architectural splendor and historic 

importance. The entrance to the Acropolis is the Propylea, which extends 150 feet
adjoining the temple of Athena Nike or 

Wingless Victory. The Parthenon is on the highest part of the Acropolis and was
built between 447 and 437 BC. It was here 

that modern democracy began its early foothold.
Athens, host of the 2004 Olympic games welcomes you.
