Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to use the Net and he won't bother you for weeks. These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. 

  Walls have ears  The devil tempts all, but the idle man tempts the devil Sympathy without relief is like mustard without beef You win some, you lose some Laughter is the best medicine. Familiarity breeds contemptChristmas comes but once a year, but Hallmark makes sure it lasts three months 
  A short absence quickens love, a long absence kills it. Bush get ears and dutty get tongue. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside  Children Have Wide Ears and Long TonguesLife is just a bowl of cherries. He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day When you want fuh swim river yuh gat fuh plunge inside fuss. One of these day is none of these days. 
  It is better to love and lost than never to love at all A good tree brings forth good fruit. To listen is to learn, and to understand is to inspire.. The more the merrier An apple a day keeps the doctor at bay A friend is not so soon gotten as lost. Trust is the mother of deceit Do right and fear no man  Idle people lack no excuses  
  All things are possible with god Never judge by appearencesEvery fowl feed pon he own craw. Diligence is the mother of good fortune The difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  When yuh dead yuh nah sabee, and when yuh sabee yuh dead. A miss is as good as a.. Mr.. Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow  No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness  There are always ears on the other side of the wall Blood is thicker than water Dont count the days, make the days count! 
  Bush get ears and dutty get tongue. Fine words butter no parsnips  The West Wind Always Brings Wet Weather, The East Wind Wet and Cold Together, the South Wind Surely Brings Us Rain, the North Wind Blows It Back Again A great dowry is a bed full of brambles.  You can have too much of a good thing Prevention is better than cure Practice makes perfect and Nobody's perfect. Time and tide wait for no man.And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. Do as I say, and not as I do 
  It is a silly fish that is caught twice with the same bait  Let sleeping dogs lie Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to use the Net and he won't bother you for weeks. The pot calls the kettle black. Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it growThe Ass Loaded With Gold Still Eats Thistles Opportunities always look bigger going than coming  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left Modulation in all things. 
  Love sees no faults. Charity covers a multitude of sinsA man in love is a fool, and an old man in love is the greatest fool of all. When in doubt, do nothing What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts There are two sides to every question A hedge between keeps friendship green. And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. 
  Love is like a fire, it can either warm your heart or burn your house down
