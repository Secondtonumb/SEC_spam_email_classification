Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi . PK - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

You never miss the water till the well runs dry. Still waters run deep. That's water under the bridge. Survival of the fittest.   Sweating blood.   Seed money. A rose is a rose is a rose. A rose is a rose is a rose. Plain as water. A place in the sun.   Watch and wait.  A thorn in my side.   Which came first, the chicken or the egg. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   That's a whole new can of worms.  

Sturdy as an oak.   The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  Through the grapevine.   Some like carrots others like cabbage. Wet behind the ears. The season of goodwill.   There may be snow on the roof, but there's fire in the belly. The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees. Put off the scent.   Through the grapevine.   Spring forward fall back. Walking on water. Up one side and down the other.
