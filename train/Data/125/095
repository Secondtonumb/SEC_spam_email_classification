From : Dr James Abel.

Dear Sir,

IMMEDIATE CONTRACT 74sx2a8.k036zu3n #:
/NNPC/PED/1183/06

From the over drafts records of outstanding contracts award due for
payment with the Federal Government of Nigeria, we discovered that the
next person on the list to be paid for this contract named: Mr. Fred
Gilliard had just died recently of HIV/AIDS and none of his family has
shown up to claim the money for this contract.

Records in our Department shows that LATE MR. FRED GILLIARD  had already
finished the contract before he died and he was only awaiting his payment
from us.
The said money ($15,000,000.00) had been in our custody in our Bank since
the last Government regime in 1999.

I wish to inform you that the said payment will be processed and the money
will be released to you as soon as you respond to this letter. Also note
that from our records,In my file the outstanding contract payment is
US$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million  united states dollars) and the
payment/transfer of this said amount will only take Five to Seven working
days.

Kindly re-confirm to me the followings:

1) Your full name.
2) Phone, fax and mobile #.
3) Company name, position and address.
4) Profession, age and marital status.
5) Your int?l passport or driving license no.

As soon as this information is received, the payment will be wired to your
nominated bank account directly from Central Bank of Nigeria.

You can e-mail me  as soon as you receive this letter for further discussion.
NB. I REALLY NEED YOUR TOTAL HONESTY AND TRUST IN THIS MATTER.


Regards,

DR JAMES ABEL.
