      For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. Give and spend and God will send Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere 
      An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  A picture paints a thousand words. These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him.
    
    
      Don't bite the hand that.. looks dirty. Opportunity seldom knocks twice.One years seeding means seven years weeding
      There is no physician like a true friend  April is the cruellest month Speed thrills. Slow fire ah boil hard cow-heel. 
    
  
  The truth will out God made the country and man made the town!Every family has a skeleton in the cupboard Modulation in all things. Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from a friends forehead Jack of all trades, master of none Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble  Never guh a store ah night fuh buy black cloth. True love never grows old Life begins at forty
