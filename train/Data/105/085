We were both married for years without children.
I do not intend to waste much of your time, my husband left some money for me which i intend to give out for charity purpose,to a God fearing individual or firm that will received and use the 
money to help ORPHANGES,WIDOWS,and PROPAGATE THE WORD OF GOD.

I am looking for someone that I can trust to handle this funds.
Because of my present condition of my health problem that is while i took this decision to give the money out is that since i do not have a child and due to my husbands belief in giving to the less previlage and before my husband died we both decided to give the money out for charity works that was our wish. And i want to carry out my husbands wish so that he will be happy with me where ever he may be.
The truth of the matter is i know that based on what is going on all over the internet, people 
find it very difficult to assist one another and also find it difficult to believe issues like this but i assure you that as soon as you can garantee me of your trust and honestly i will be able to work with you.
