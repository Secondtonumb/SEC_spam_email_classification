Greetings from Singapore!

If you are planning your trip to Singapore for the QS Asia Pacific Professional Leaders in Education Conference (12 - 25 July) - syl.po3ktq5.org - or the QS Partners in Education Workshop (9 - 25 July) - syl.y9y52mvv48.com - why not save yourself both travel time and money by staying, in considerable comfort and for great value, under the same roof?

Nestled amongst the hills and greenery of the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the Nanyang Executive Centre (NEC) - venue for both events - is strategically tucked away from the hassle and bustle of city life. The Guestroom Wing at NEC consists of 170 Executive Rooms which are all tastefully furnished. Each room comes complete with room service and amenities such as television with cable channels, bar fridge, free internet broadband connection, electronic key card access, hair dryer, telephone and alarm-cum-radio clock.

A stone?s throw away from NEC, there are several lifestyle facilities such as the NTU Sports and Recreation Centre with its Olympic-sized pool, basketball court and running track. Also, there is the NTU Staff Club with its own fitness centre, restaurant and bar lounge.

For booking enquiries and prices, please call the reservation hotline at +65 6790 6699 or email ntu-45l@n38.edu.57 quoting the Reference ?QS Conference 12 - 25 July 2006?. Booking form can also be download at the website http://syl.n38.edu.57/NEC/Accommodation/. All reservation will be on a first come first served basis and subject to availability at the time of booking.
