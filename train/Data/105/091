Dear Wedend.

y name is Mr. James Oni, I am the credit manager of Access Bank 
Plc. I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money 
from a deceased account.

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been 
taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided 
to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION;

I am the account officer of a foreigner named Barbara Hatleberg and her 
husband Glenn Hatleberg who died in an air crash along with his wife on 
the January 25 in an Alaska airline Flight 261 with other passengers on 
board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published 
by

syl.9x1.com/2000/US/02/01/62tsbw.kfn02vm6.j925

Since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for 
this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident 
himself and his wife (May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the 
fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the 
next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a 
next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully 
worked out by me for the funds (US$25,500,000,00) to be released in your 
favor as the beneficiary's next of kin.

Because after four years the money will be called back to the bank 
treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of 
the bank. 

so it is on this note I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used 
as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank 
directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the 
year.

It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an 
order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please 
acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business 
endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are 
interested.

1. A Beneficiary name. In order for me to prepare the document for 
transfer of the funds in your name.

2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and 
mutual trust in each other.

I shall be compensating you with Four million dollars (US$7,650,000.00) 
which is 30% on final conclusion of this project for your assistance, 
while we will retain US$16,575,000 which is 65% dollars and 5% 
(US$1,275,000.00)goes for expenses.

Because I intend to retire after the conclusion of this transaction. If 
this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me 
immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in 
you, I await your urgent response. 

Regards,

g4.g6l02 Oni
