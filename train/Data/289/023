FROGS
 
Once upon a time there was a bunch of tiny frogs.... who arranged a running competition. 

The goal was to reach the top of a very high tower. 

A big crowd had gathered around the tower to see the race and cheer on the contestants.... 

The race began.... 

Honestly,no one in crowd really believed that the tiny frogs would reach the top of the tower. 

You heard statements such as: 

"Oh, WAY too difficult!!" 

"They will NEVER make it to the top." 

or: 

"Not a chance that they will succeed. The tower is too high!" 




The tiny frogs began collapsing. One by one.... 

Except for those, who in a fresh tempo, were climbing higher and higher..
