      Trust is the mother of deceit Bees that have honey in their mouths have stings in their tails Only mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun  The young man thinks the old mans stupid but the old man KNOWS the young man is
      A baby is an alimentary canal with a loud voice at one end and no responsibility at the other. Wedlock is a padlock
    
     
      A fool and his money are soon parted.Mother knows best Prevention is better than cure. We had nothing to do and we did it very well 
      Half a loaf is better than none. Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness The bigger the better. Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  Happiness is wanting what you have - not having what you want They that walk much in the sun will be tanned at last It is foolish to deal with a fool Common fame is seldom to blame 
    
  
  The first faults are theirs that commit them, the second theirs that permit themDo not use a hatchet to remove a fly from a friends forehead Never speak ill of the dead  If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. . The pot calls the kettle black Watch your thoughts, they become words Watch your words, they become actions, watch your actions, they become habits, watch your habits, they become characer Watch your character, it becomes your destiny  A book holds a house of gold. Live to the point of tears Revenge is sweet
