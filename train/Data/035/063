As Christianity spread throughout Europe the celebration changed to honor th
e "Mother Church" - the spiritual power that gave them life and protected th
em from harm. Over time the church festival blended with the Mothering Sunda
y celebration . People began honoring their mothers as well as the church.
　　随着基督教在欧洲的广泛传播，这一天逐渐演变为"母亲礼拜日", 以纪念给予基督
徒生命和保护他们不受伤害的精神力量。再以后，对"母亲礼拜日"和"妈妈的星期天"逐
渐合为一体。此后，人们在这一天中就既庆祝母亲的节日又举行基督教的礼拜。
