During this time many of the England's poor worked as servants for the wealt
hy. As most jobs were located far from their homes, the servants would live 
at the houses of their employers. On Mothering Sunday the servants would hav
e the day off and were encouraged to return home and spend the day with thei
r mothers. A special cake, called the mothering cake, was often brought alon
g to provide a festive touch.
　　在那时，许多英国穷人都在有钱人家做仆人。因为这些穷人住的地方往往距离主人
家较远，所以他们常常就住在雇主的家中。而在每年的"妈妈星期天"这一天，主人常常
会给他的仆人放一天假，鼓励他们回家去与自己的母亲共度此日。同时，为了庆祝这一
天，人们还常常会带一种特殊的蛋糕（称为"母亲蛋糕"）回家给自己的母亲。
