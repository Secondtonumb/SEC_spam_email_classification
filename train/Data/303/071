Kano.

Hello,

I 
write you this letter in good faith and to the glory of almighty that 
thus brought me out clean after all the allegations levelled against me 
after the death of my father (former Nigerian military head of states).

Since my father's death and my detention, my family has been
loosing a 
lot of money due to vindictive government officials who are bent on 
dealing with my family. My family and I are looking for a trustworthy 
foreign partner who can assist us in receiving some amount of money 
($1,500,000.00) for investment purposes. This money is presently in the 
possession of a Vaulting company abroad.

This money was of course 
acquired by my late father 
and is now kept secretly by the family, the 
money is in cash. 

As soon as i hear from you,i will give you all 
necessary details as to how we intend carrying out the whole 
transaction. Please, do not entertain any fears, as all necessary 
modalities are in place, and i assure you of all success and safety in 
this transaction.

If you are interested in assisting me please send 
me 
Your consent and telephone number, you may also ignore this Letter 
and respect my trust in you by not exposing this transaction, should 
you not be interested.

I look forward to working with you.

Thank you

Alhaji Mohammed.A
