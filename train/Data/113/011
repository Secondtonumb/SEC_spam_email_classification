You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. Sick as a dog.  Watered 71nr.az40 end of the 0h6uk.1ja179 like chicken.  Stone cold sober.  A thing of beauty is a joy forever.  Run to seed. Worked night and 0u9.5243's a whole new can of worms.  Slow as a snail.  Two peas in a pod. Tall as a tree.  The scum of the earth.  Tastes like chicken.  What's good for the goose is good for the svng43.aj'll hand you out to 209.jr one side and down the other.  When the cows come home. A tree does not move unless there is wind.  Sweet as apple pie.  Useless as tits on bull.  Survival of the fittest.
