  Stir With a Knife, Stir Up Strife You never know what you can do until you try   Life is just a bowl of cherries A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. Fools and madmen speak the truth A Good Tongue is a Good Weapon. A fool will laugh when he is drowning. Happy is the bride the sun shines on  These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. There is always somebody worst of then yourself no matter how bad things seem  A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.  Business before pleasure 
  A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. You can lead a horse to water but.. how?.  Virtue is its own reward Poor men seek meat for their stomach; rich men stomach for their meat One beats the bush, another takes the bird Zeal without knowledge, is fire without light
