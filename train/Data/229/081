I am a retired professor of mechanisms. For forty years of teaching, I have finished writing this <Composite Mechanisms>.
I wonder if it is a good way to contact you for publishing. Please tell me whether you are interested to accepting it. Sample chapters as it is so big a volume would be given if you wanted later.
Thanking you in advance and looking forward to receiving in early favorable reply.
Sincerely yours
Yan, zhenying
