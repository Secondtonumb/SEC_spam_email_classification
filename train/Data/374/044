Dear Friend,

I have been waiting for your response after my initial message to you concerning a very important
and urgent matter. As you responded that you will get back to me, or maybe that was your auto-
responder, I am resending the same message again with hope that you will give it a fair and considerable
thought.

This involves transferring to your overseas account the sum of  ($7.5M US Dollars) seven million five hundred 
thousand dollars, from one of the Fidelity  Finance & Security Company  here in Dakar-Senegal.

I am Jamil A. Troure the Auditor General in the Fidelity finance & Security Company  here in Dakar Senegal, 
During the course of our auditing , I discovered a floating fund in an account opened since 1982 and till date 
no body has operated or filed papers to claim the fund.

After going through the records I discovered that the owner of the account, Engr. Mahmoud Hisham, an 
Iraqi oil merchant, died in the month of October 2005 in an auto crash. Since there was not infomation concerning 
additional members of his family, next of kin or known relation, the fund has been declared  floating and if nobody 
comes forward for it, will be forfeited to the government.

Since I hardly know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner to stand and apply as his next of kin 
because this money can only be approved to a foreigner as his next of kin or business partner.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any 
foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you upon your positive response and once I am 
convinced of your capability and assurance that you will never never let me down.

At the conclussion of this project ,we may proceed into an investment as equal partners with you in charge, pending my 
resignation from the company, but method of sharing profit should be based on 15% for you and rest for me
and my colleague.

Regarding moral justification of the fund ,i wouldn't want you to consider it sinful. If you had being the victim ,Certainly you 
wouldn't be happy having your hard earned fund shared among  government as an unclaimed deposit I believe they are 
many other aspects of life we may contribute with this fund to help the less priveledged and the needy in our society .

Furnish me with your direct telephone & Fax number for easy comminucation and please reply to me on this emails: 

jamil_troure02@yahoo.com
jamil_troure@she.com

I look forward to your earliest response.

Jamil A. Troure
