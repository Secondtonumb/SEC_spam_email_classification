Take your time and time will take you  Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give

      An idle mind is.. the best way to relax. Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat  Elementary sartorial techniques initially applied obviate the need for repetitive similar actions to the square of three.
      Kill two birds with one stone The truth will out Curses, like chickens, come home to roost
    
    
      Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. A fool gives; a wise man takes.Many people know how to say nothing; few know when The best things in life are free
      A man comes from the dust and in the dust he will end - and in the meantime it is good to drink a sip of vodka. Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. Some are wise and some are otherwise They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Golden dishes will never turn black  
    
  
  Shame face ah feel like cent ice.A man is judged by his deeds, not by his words. Everyday is a fresh slate He who wants to do good, knocks at the gate, he who loves finds the gates open A crowd is not company.  Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. None so deaf as those who will not hear  Lil ah sick, big a get better. Never judge by appearences
