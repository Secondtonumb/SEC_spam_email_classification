As part of the commitment of Falcon Energy, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, to keep
investors informed of its status and activities, the company is providing this
investor update.

Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount

investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since
the well was
first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that time
was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed
over 10.00 per
MBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range.

for the company
and its shareholders.
