Wedsday Oct 23, 12:14 pm ET

BEVERLY HILLS,
Calif.--(BUSI_NESS WIRE)--May 23, 2006--L International Computers Inc. (Pin,k Sheets: LITL) through its wholly owned subsidiary, Liebermann Inc., a renowned
manufacturer of high-performance computers and personal technology, today
announced the next generation Grand Canyon display that will be bringing desktop
views and resolutions to unheard of new heights.



The displays will be available in configurations based on single display size
panels of 17", 19", 24" and 32" ranging from 1280x768 pixels to 1440x900 pixels,
1680x1050 and 1920x1200 pixel individual resolution.

When compared to L's first generations Grand Canyon, the new displays have a
remarkably smaller separating seam per panel bringing an unparalleled sense of
unified desktop space and ultra-wide screen royalty. L's next-generation of
large format multi-panel displays represent the pinnacle of computer displays
technology for creative professionals, demanding graphics, digital photography,
design, gaming, rich-content creation, video, audio and large venue presentation
requirements delivering world-leading resolutions, allied to extremely wide
viewing angles, unmatched color depth, and near-instantaneous pixel video
response times inherent to OLED Technology.

iguel Liebermann, CEO of 'L', stated "Delivering superior image quality in
contrast, video response, and color reproduction, the new displays are
compatible with PC, Mac, HP, SG, Wed and all video standards. They are the
solution for creative professionals and critical digital imaging scenarios,
covering the viewing area of several high resolution monitors with a smaller
comparable physical footprint. L's next-generation large format multi-panel
displays represent an industry benchmark years ahead of the competition."
