Dear Sirs: 
Cyota, an anti-fraud and security company, is under contract to assist
Royal Bank of Canada and its related entities ("RBC") - A leading
Canadian bank - in preventing or terminating online activity that
targets RBC's clients as potential fraud victims. 
Cyota has been made aware that you appear to be providing Internet
Services to a fraudulent Web site, which is part of a "phishing scam"*.
This activity violates RBC's copyright, trademark and other intellectual
property rights and may violate the criminal laws of Canada, the United
States and other nations.
E-mail messages have been broadly distributed to individuals by a person
or entity pretending to be RBC. These e-mails use RBC's name and
identity (including trademarks) without authorization. The e-mails
request recipients to verify and submit sensitive details related to
their RBC accounts.
Within the fraudulent e-mail message, there is a link that leads the
recipients to a fraudulent website displaying RBC's copyrighted
materials and trademarks. The fraudulent website is located at the
following URL address http://218.27.100.202/rbc/,
http://60.208.83.86/rbc/) to which you provide services and which is
under your control.
The fraudulent website not only represents a misuse of RBC's
intellectual property; its purpose is to improperly obtain personal
information of RBC customers in order to fraudulently access their bank
accounts. The people behind those websites typically perpetrate
identity-theft related activities, such as using customer's credit cards
or bank accounts without authorization. In addition, since the vast
majority of all of the e-mails are not being sent to actual RBC
customers, the actions serve to damage the reputation and image of RBC.
Please take all necessary steps to immediately shut down the fraudulent
website, terminate its availability to the Internet and discontinue the
transmission of any e-mails associated with this website.
We understand that you may not be aware of this improper use of your
services and we appreciate your cooperation. We specifically would ask
that you also take the following actions:
* Please provide us with a tar/zip file of the source code for this
site, so that we may analyze it to help prevent further attacks.
* If any customer data has been captured that is stored on your systems
or equipment, please send us that data so that the customers to whom
that data relates can be notified and take steps to protect their
credit.
* Please provide a copy of any records you maintain that indicate the
name, contact information, method of payment or similar information that
may be useful in helping learn the identity and location of the customer
for whom the website has been operated.
Thank you for your cooperation to prevent and terminate this fraudulent
activity. 

Sincerely,
