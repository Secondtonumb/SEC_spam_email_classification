 Dear, I am Balls Aylick, an Attorney to Late, mrs. Violeta Bogojevic a foreigner and one of the Leaders in the Cosmetological Industry. Late Mrs. Violeta Bogojevic  has an account with F.A.B which she set up in 2000. 

She died in 2004 in UK. I received a memo early this year from the international remittance unit of First Active Bank for an interview about $45M USD that belongs to my client Late Mrs. Violeta Bogojevic. 

The Bank informed me on their policy to Freeze the same account and redirect her funds $45M USD back to government treasury because they saw no NEXT OF KIN in her entire file within the bank and her account has been dormant for many years which is against the policy of the F.A.B.

 I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account as the foreign beneficiary to that fund.I have resolved to share the money in this ratio: 45% for me,30% for you , 20% for the remittance manager in the bank who has agreed to guide us for the 
success of our objectives and 5% for expences we might incurre in the processing of this transaction. 

Note that this transaction is totally risk free, and as such, the nature of your business does not matter in the completing of this transaction. 

FOR US TO PROCEED:

I will need your full name and address,or any name that you might want us to use in processing the documents of fund release in your name,and the name of the bank where you might want it processed and transferred/remitted into. 

I will also need your telephone and fax numbers for oral 
communications too.I will start the processing of all the legal documents to back up our claim since i am the Attorney to the late account owner, so i have every details and there will be noting diffcult in completing this in few days, immediately you send all the required information.I will give you further details on the entire process when i receive your positive response.
