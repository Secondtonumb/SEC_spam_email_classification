Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi . PK - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

A weed is no more than a flower in disguise.  Still water runs dirty and deep.   Root it out. A stick in the mud.   Stubborn as a mule.   Tools of the trade.  Turn over a new leaf. Stop, look and listen. Survival of the fittest.   Too little too late.   That's water under the bridge. She's the apple of my eye.   Top of the morning.    Stir up an ant's nest.   Weed it out.  Tossed around like a hot potato.   Sweating blood.   You never miss the water till the well runs dry.

Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Your ass is grass. They're like two peas in a pod.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.  Sitting on the fence. Survival of the fittest.   Waking up with the chickens. Sweating blood.   Stone cold sober.   A snail's pace. She's a mother hen.   Rare as walking on water.  There is always next year.   Stop and smell the roses. Shit end of the stick. Welcome to my garden.  You can't teach an old dog new tricks.  The scum of the earth.
