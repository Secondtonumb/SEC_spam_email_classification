To have is to hold and to hold is to have Things that come to those who wait may be things left by those who got there first  At the end of the game, the King and the pawn go back in the same box

      It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise Doubt is the beginning not the end of wisdom Its a dogs life One man's meat is another man's poison..
      The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak A tidy house holds a bored woman. A fool and his money are soon parted.
    
    
      Judge not that you be not judged Work expands so as to fill the time availableSix of one, half a dozen of the other . The proof of the pudding is in the eating The world is full of willing people: some willing to work and some willing to let them 
      The higher the tree, the sweeter the plum  Nowt so queer as folk! Sympathy without relief is like mustard without beef You are a long time dead The last drop makes the cup run over Dead men tell no tales 
    
  
  But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way. I have found at my age going bra-less pulls all the wrinkles out of my face.  Revenge is a dish best served cold Like flogging a dead horse Adversity doesnt build character, it reveals it  Nah because dog ah play with yuh he nah bite yuh. Cleanliness is next to Godliness The more you get, the more you want Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  Great oaks from little acorns grow Loving life is living life to the fullest
