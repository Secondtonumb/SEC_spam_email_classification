ALPHA BANK LONDON

DEAR ,

RE:TRANSFER 
OF 113,000,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. 

I feel quite safe 
dealing with you in this important xn5e34mw.wvk7a1, this medium 
(Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it 
because it still remains the fastest medium of ommunication. However, 
this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated 
as such.

At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 
100% risk and trouble free to both parties.

IN ORDER TO TRANSFER OUT 
(One Hundred and Thirteen Million  POUNDS STERLINGS) FROM OUR BANK HERE 
IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF
CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS 
ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader who was believed to acquire 
the fund through his secret Crude Oil deal with the Former IRAQI 
xen8qs78w4.n0k deceased died with all the members of his family in an 
auto-accident in JUNE 23, 2003 without a WILL. The amount involved is 
[113,000,000.00 POUNDS STERLINGS].

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO 
A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN 
TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE 
DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT
BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE 
BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE 
THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. 

Let me hear from you URGENTLY by 
Email me for more detail. 

Regards,
g4.1m63b Michael.
