Speed thrills. 

  Fine feathers make fine birds Clothes make a man A drowning man will clutch at straws. All that glisters is not gold  If Fortune calls, offer him a seat  The first step is the hardest One of these day is none of these days. Every fowl feed pon he own craw.A penny saved makes Jack a dull boy. Opportunities always look bigger going than coming  
  Sleep is better than medicine Revenge is sweet The Moon does not heed the barking of dogs  Prevention is better than cure What boots up must come down. Fools build houses, and wise men live in themIn the coldest flint there is hot fire When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern  Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people  A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  Silence is the fence around wisdom 
  Belly full behind drunk. If you lie down with dogs you will come up with fleas  Rain, Rain, go away, come back another day Turtle nah want trouble mek he walk with he house pon he back.A constant guest is never welcome. Angry Men Make Themselves a Bed of Nettles A nod is as good as a wink to a blind man. To whom God gives, to him also the people give  To listen is to learn, and to understand is to inspire.. Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. 
  Beauty without grace is like a hook without bait. .Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery One good turn deserves another Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today A fool and his money are soon parted. Everyone stretches his legs according to the length of his coverlet Imagination is the highest kite you can fly Birds of a feather flock together Too many cooks spoil the brothLife is beautiful 
  Only mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun  Once in a blue moon In vino veritas  Everyone must row with the oars he has. Man who wants pretty nurse, must be patient A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern  Cheats never prosper as strong as loveFate leads the willing but drives the stubborn A problem is a chance for you to do your best. Never judge a book by its cover 
  Many are called but few are chosen Zeal without knowledge is the sister of folly Eat well, stay fit, die anyway. A stitch in time saves nine . Man cannot live on bread alone Four things drive a man out of his house: too much smoke, a dripping roof, filthy air and a scolding wife Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions 
  He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon Better to be safe than sorry Beauty without virtue is a flower without perfumeA good man is hard to find. Home sweet home As you shall make your bed, so shall you..........mess it up. A constant guest is never welcome. Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see  Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. A fool gives; a wise man takes. 
  Pain is so close to pleasure Beauty without virtue is a flower without perfume
