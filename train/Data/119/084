      Good broth may be made in an old pot The pot calls the kettle black You're never too old to learn. The best things come in small packages
      In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has A slip of the tongue is no fault of the mind and he who laughs is very unkind.
    
    
      Why bark when you can get a dog to do it Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  Faint heart never won fair lady
      Merry Nights Make Sorry Days A creaking door hangs longest. There is safety in numbers A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept. 
    
  
  If you believe everything you read, you better not readOld friends and wine are best  Time waits for nobody Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief. A disposition towards inquiry deprived the feline of its vital state. Out of the frying pan and into the fire . A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy.
