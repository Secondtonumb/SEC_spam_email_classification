      Corporations have neither bodies to be punished nor souls to be damned  Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. Good talk saves the food Rained on ground hardens (Japanese Proverb) A little of what you fancy does you good. 
      He is an ill companion that has a good memory  An apple a day keeps the doctor at bay Penny wise, pound foolish They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Talk about things of tomorrow and the mice inside the ceiling laugh
    
    
      A bad excuse is better than none.Perfection is inperfect He who plays with fire will get burnt

  Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. Well Begun is Half DoneNone so deaf as those who will not hear  Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice Absence makes the heart grow fonder. A new broom sweeps clean. History repeats itself The higher you climb up the ladder, the more people can see your arse  A closed mouth gathers no feet.  In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has
