Welcome to the valley! he said.
Thank you! said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off

the only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you

Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay awhile. Elvish
singing is not a thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care
for such things.
