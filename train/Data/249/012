                                Wits Basin has an incredible 
                                double-play happening in the world of gold 
                                mining! In Colorado, the famous Bates-Hunter 
                                Gold Mine kicked off the 1859 Gold Rush and 
                                established Denver as a major American city. 
                                With skyrocketing gold prices, this mine is 
                                being brought back to life  and geological 
                                experts say that it may host up to 10-million 
                                ounces of gold. The company is now planning to 
                                mine the first of the major veins here, which 
                                could contain more than 1-million ounces of 
                                gold! Drilling in the 1990s confirmed grades of 
                                0.45 oz./ton over 10-foot widths, and showed 
                                that gold veins may continue beyond the 800-foot 
                                levels up to depths of 2,400 
                                feet!
                                
                                
                                In South Africa, Wits Basin 
                                controls a 35% interest, with the right to earn 
                                up to 50%, on more than several hundred thousand 
                                acres adjacent to the Witwatersrand Basin, the 
                                most prolific gold-producing region in the world 
                                 which has produced 1.5 billion oz. gold. The 
                                companys property here could host 100-million 
                                oz. gold or more! Current exploration programs 
                                have identified the same type of rocks at depth 
                                as overlie the gold-bearing strata at the 
                                adjoining Witwatersrand Basin.
