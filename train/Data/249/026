Hospital? Walter Reed. He was in a psych session with a military this
morning, and when it was over he never came out to his detail. They
waited twenty minutes or so, then went in to find him and his escort
because he was on a tight schedule. They were told he left. Thats crazy!V k A n L d I i U k M o
