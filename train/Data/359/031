friendly-this is a very old bird indeed, and is maybe the last left of
the ancient breed that used to live about here, tame to the hands of my
father and grandfather. They were a long-lived and magical race, and
this might even be one of those that were alive then, a couple of
hundreds years or more ago. The Men of Dale used to have the river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the
ford. When they had dried in the sun, which was now strong and warm,
they were refreshed, if still sore and a little hungry. Soon they
crossed the ford (carrying the hobbit), and then began to march through
the long green grass and down the lines of the wide-armed oaks and the
tall elms.
And why is it called the Carrock? asked Bilbo as he went along at
the wizards side.

<DIV>you fare!  They begged him not to leave them. They offered him<BR>
dragon-gold and silver and jewels, but he would not change his mind.<BR>
   We shall see, we shall see! he said, and I think I have earned<BR>
already some of your dragon-gold ?? when you have got it.<BR>
   After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes<BR>
and bathed in the river, which was sh or more ago. The Men of Dale used to have the trick of<BR>
understanding their language, and used them for messengers to fly to the<BR>
en of the Lake and elsewhere. Well, hell have news to take to<BR>
Lake-town all right, if that is what he is after, said Bilbo; though I<BR>
dont suppose there are any people left there that trouble with<BR>
thrush-language.<BR>
   Why what has happened? cried the dwarves. Do get on with your tale!<BR>
   So Bilbo told them all he could remember, and he confessed that he<BR>
had a nasty feeling that the dragon guessed too much from his riddles<BR></DIV></BODY></HTML>
