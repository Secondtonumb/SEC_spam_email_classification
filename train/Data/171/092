A leopard cannot change its spots.

      What does not kill you makes you stronger There's no fool like an old fool. To the victor the spoils  Diligence is the mother of good fortune
      A stitch in time saves nine. There is no time like the present Some are wise and some are otherwise
    
    
      It is good to be knowledgeable, but better to be lovable  In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashedChaste makes waste. When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  One of these days is none of these days.
      We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. Learn to say no It will be of more use to you than to be able to read Latin  Fine words butter no parsnips  Smile and the world smiles with you, snore and you sleep alone There Are No Atheists in Foxholes He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others Man who wants pretty nurse, must be patient 
    
  
  True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls  But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. If you want a place in the sun, you must leave the shade of the family treeGood gubby nah ah float ah tap. A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spirit Youth nah ah weary but he ah fall down. A fool and his money are soon parted. Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught When the student is ready, the master will appear  To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. Constant dripping wears away the stone Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tear Ill-gotten gains never prosper The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak Some are Wise and Some are Otherwise
