      What's good for the goose is good for the gander. What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity
      The pen is mightier than the sword. Happy is the bride the sun shines on The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones
    
     
      After the storm comes the calm Fruit out of season, sorrow out of reasonSeven years nah too much fuh wash speck off ah bird neck.
      You only live once To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow Don't cross your bridges before you get to them. Blood is thicker than water 
    
  
  He that plants a tree plants for posterityWherever you may be let your wind go free Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man. It never rains, but it pours. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. A tidy house holds a bored woman. Lend your money and lose your friend Seeing is believing
