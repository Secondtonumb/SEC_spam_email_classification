      Beauty is only skin deep Agree, For The Law is Costly You can have too much of a good thing He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing
      The pot calls the kettle black Do not look where you fell, but where you slipped  In the coldest flint there is hot fire Fax is stranger than fiction. Too many chiefs and not enough indians
    
    
      Opportunity seldom knocks twiceWhah hurt eye does mek nose run water. The pen is mightier than the sword.
      To listen is to learn, and to understand is to inspire.. A penny saved makes Jack a dull boy. The best things in life are free The pen is mightier than the sword Mind your own business The Devil rides upon a fiddlestick 
    
  
  When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. Half a loaf is better than none. A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.Under the thorn grow the roses  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. Birds of a feather flock together. What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive Look before you leap The devil tempts all, but the idle man tempts the devil Is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness Every rope gat two ends. The last straw breaks the camel's back.
