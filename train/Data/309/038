Dear Professor Lan.

First of all I would like to send you the best regards from Professor 
Hermann Simon the Chairman of Simon-Kucher & Partners. The last year was 
very successful for Simon, Kucher & Partners. We realized a growth of more 
than 13% and a revenue of 53 m Euro. I hope that we will continue our 
positive business development. 

Asia is naturally one of the main focus areas for our consulting practice. 
Our last Japan-China-Strategy-Forum was attended by more than140 managers. 
The content-packed event had speakers from seven companies, among others 
the CEOs of Heidelberg, Schott Electronics and Henkel Japan, and the 
Executive Vice Presidents of Flextronics and Bosch Rexroth.

During that event we also presented our new publication on business 
development in China. It will be published by Springer Publishing, 
Berlin/New York in the July. We would be greatly honoured if you agree to 
contribute a testimonial for its back-cover of the book. Please find 
attached the testimonials we received so far.

I do hope that you will accept this invitation. If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact us.

Best regards

Dr. Markus B. Hofer
Partner
