Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

-----------------------
The scythe ran into a stone. Timber! A place in the sun.   Waking up with the chickens. What on earth? Shit end of the stick. Say it with flowers.   Weed it out.  Walking on water. Read the tea leaves. When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Root it out. She has a green thumb. Where man is not nature is barren. Water doesn't run uphill.   Wet behind the ears. To rule the mountains is to rule the river.   That's a real stem winder.   Weed out. Spill the beans.   Timber! Tossed around like a hot potato.   Till the cows come home.  

Shake like a leaf. Walking on water. Still waters run deep. Slow as molasses in January. Put to bed with a shovel. Still waters run deep. Rough as a cob. Under the weather. Read the tea leaves. Where man is not nature is barren. Spring rain, Fall gold. The sun will shine into our yard to.   A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Tastes like chicken.   Stop and smell the roses. Tossed around like a hot potato.   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. Putting it in a nutshell.   Rise and shine. Take time to smell the roses. Shit happens.   When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Tall as a tree.   That's a whole new can of worms.
