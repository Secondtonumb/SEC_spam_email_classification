Jokes of the day
Blonde Hemorrhoids 
A young blonde was having problems with her first case of hemorrhoids. With all the burning, itching and swelling she didn't know what to do. 
She calls her older blonde friend and says, "I'm itching, burning and it's swollen - what can I do?" 
The older blonde says, "You have hemorrhoids. I'll go down to the pharmacy and get you some Preparation H; that will take care of your swelling and itching. You just set still." 
After about an hour the young blonde was itching and burning more and more. 
The older blonde delivers the Preparation H and tells the young blonde, "Take this and you will be better in about an hour. I'll call and check up on you in a couple of hours." 
The young blonde, not reading the directions, rips open the box and swallows the whole tube, thinking this is the worst taste she has ever ran across her lips. She tries to spit it out but has no luck. 
The phone rings and she answers, "Ssssswwwellooooo." 
It's the older blonde. She asks, "So, how are your hemorrhoids?" 
The young blonde replies, "They still itch and burn but I can whistle better than ever before!" 
Injun Trouble 
Back in the old Wild West, there were two blonde cowpokes, Jeff and Dave. One day, the two were enjoying a strong sarsaparilla in the local saloon, when a man walked into the bar with an Indian's head under his arm. 
The barman shakes his hand and says, "I hate Indians; last week the bastards burnt my barn to the ground, assaulted my wife and killed my children." He then says, "If any man brings me the head of an Indian, I'll give him one thousand dollars." 
The two blondes looked at each other and walked out of the bar to go hunting for an Indian. They were walking around for a while when suddenly they saw one; Jeff threw a rock which hit the Indian right on the head. 
The Indian fell off his horse, but landed seventy feet down a ravine. The two nuts made their way down the ravine where Dave pulled out a knife to claim their trophy.
Suddenly, Jeff said, "Dave, take a look at this." Dave replied, "Not now, I'm busy." 
Jeff tugged him on the shoulder and says, "I really think you should look at this."
Dave said, "Look, you can see I'm busy. There's a thousand dollars in my hand." 
But Jeff was adamant. "Please, Dave, take a look at this." 
So Dave looked up and saw that standing at the top of the ravine were five thousand red Indians. 
Dave just shook his head and said, "Oh my  God!  we're going to be millionaires!"
