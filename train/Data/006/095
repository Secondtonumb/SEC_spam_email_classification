If you kiss her, you are not a gentlement.
If you don't, you are not a man.

If you praise her, she thinks you are lying.
If you don't, you are good for nothing.

If you agree to all her likes, she is abusing.
If you don't, you are not understanding.

If you make romance, you are an "Experienced man"
If you don't, you are half a man.

If you visit her too often, she thinks it is boring.
If you don't, she accuses you of double crossing.

If you are well-dressed, she says you are a playboy.
If you don't, you are a dull boy.

If you jealous, she says it is bad.
If you don't, she thinks you do not love her.

If you attempt a romance, she says you do not respect her.
If you don't, she thinks you do not like her.

If you are a minute late, she complains it is hard to wait.
If she is late, she says that is girl's way.

If you visit another, she accuses you of being heel.
If she is visited by another, "Oh it's natural, we are girls"

If you kiss her once a while, she professes you are cold.
If you kiss her too many, she yells that you are taking advantage.

If you fail to help her in crossing the street, you lack ethics.
If you do, she thinks it is just one of the man's tactics.

If you stare at others, she accuses you of flirting.
If she is stared by others, she says that they are just admiring.

If you talk, she wants you to listen.
If you listen, she wants you to talk.

"Oh God! you created those creature called 'Women'"
So simple, yet so complex.
So weak, yet so powerful.
So confusing, yet so desirable.

O Lord...tell me what to do. Amen.
