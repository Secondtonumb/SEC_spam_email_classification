Thoughs about love fall in three levels.
Young and inmature emphasize on ji1qin1
Then on reality"can we get along or sth.
fit for marriege"
Howeversome take it as being fancyor getting
big chance or other stuff
Find which level you are on and make friendswith the
same levels, you can avoid some hurt.
Some boys are so good and some girls are so charming
but if they are not on the same level as you, probably
there is some hurt between you when you find the purpose
contradicts the love.
On same levelif mistake, it's more from love not others
may be more memorable .
But it's not easy to find other's level if they intend to
be on ther levels.
Have a love matching your personality!
