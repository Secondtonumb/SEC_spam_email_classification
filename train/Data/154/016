      Love nature , live lightly Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense It ain't over 'till it's over. Waste not, want not
      Lightning never strikes twice in the same place Love laughs at the locksmiths Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
    
    
      Life is just a bowl of cherriesCaught between the devil and the deep blue sea .
      Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. There Are No Atheists in Foxholes Better to be envied than pitied Lil ah sick, big a get better. 
    
  
  He who sups with the devil should have a long spoonStone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both The longest rope has an end Confidence is a plant of slow growth A cat may look at a king. Every cloud has a silver lining If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick  The eyes speak as much as the mouth Life is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved
