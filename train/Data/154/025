Recent News:	

- Vin0b|e, Inc.(VNBL), June 27th 2006- today announced last week that 
drilling had begun on the Clovelly South Prospect's Allain-Lebreton 
No. 25 well. The Company has been notified by the operator that 
casing was set and as of today drilling has reached a depth of 
5,863 feet. As previously announced, the original proposed target 
was to test the "M" Sand at a depth of approximately 13,500 feet with
a prospective size of 3.6m barrels of oil.
(Please go Read the full Press Release.)

- Approval of a purchase agreement for the Hazard Lake oil property.

This means we have about thirty days of anticipation until we get
the drilling results. We expect the price to push steadily up
over this time with a big boom coming when the final results are 
announced! The time to get in is now before this thing rockets!
