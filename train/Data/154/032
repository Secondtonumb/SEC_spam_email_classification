ABSTRACT:
Hydrogen sulfide sorption activities of manganese oxide and Mn-Fe-Cu mixed oxide sorbents were examined in a fixed bed reactor. Sulfur retention capacity of Mn-O sorbent was found to be quite high at 600 °C both in the absence and presence of hydrogen gas (0.17 and 0.14 g S/g sorbent, respectively). This sorbent has a high porosity and a relatively high surface area. Best regeneration temperature of this sorbent was found as 700 °C, with a gas stream containing 6% oxygen in nitrogen. Mn-Fe-Cu mixed oxide sorbent had a lower sulfur retention capacity (0.07 g S/g sorbent). However, both of these sorbents gave quite high initial sorption rate constants, resulting very sharp breakthrough curves. Deactivation model was shown to give good agreement with the experimental H2S breakthrough curves.

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, the primary components of a PEM fuel cell for automotive applications, using methane as a fuel, are analyzed. Basic chemical engineering principles are utilized to assess the role of thermodynamics, heat transport, and reaction kinetics. The amount of methane required is calculated as function of hydrogen produced as well as the power produced. The heat duty for thermal control of the system is analyzed.

ABSTRACT:
A two-stage, micro trickle-bed reactor (for studies of the effects of hydrogen sulfide on hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of Athabasca bitumen-derived heavy gas oil over commercial NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst) has been simulated. One dimensional homogeneous mass transfer and a two dimensional heat transfer models were developed. The essence of the simulation was to enhance the understanding of the effects of hydrogen sulfide in the hydrotreating catalyst bed in a two-stage mode and also to predict the catalyst requirements for deep HDS and HDN processes. The kinetic model used in the simulation was based on the Langmuir-Hingshelwood method of rate determination. Adsorption constants were estimated by non-linear least squares method. The kinetic models were tested on independent set of data and found to predict the experimental data satisfactorily. The mass transfer simulation considered the effects of variables such as temperature and catalyst loading or liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on the trends of hydrogen sulfide generation and, sulfur and nitrogen conversions along the catalyst bed. The model was numerically solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta technique. The 1:3 wt/wt catalyst loading with inter-stage hydrogen sulfide removal was found to give the best HDN and HDS activities. Simulated results showed that doubling the present catalyst mass and operating at 653 °C with inter-stage hydrogen sulfide removal would give 25 and 179 ppm product sulfur and nitrogen, respectively. On the other hand, without hydrogen sulfide removal, only 49 and 302 ppm product sulfur and nitrogen could be attained, respectively. The heat transfer simulation compared temperature profiles in the two-stage process to a single stage process for the 1:3 wt/wt catalyst loading at 653 K. The temperature regime in Stage II was found to be more uniform unlike Stage I and the single stage. Crank Nicholson algorithm was used to solve the 2-D partial differential equations.

ABSTRACT:
Using 'flame-synthesized' nanoparticles (nps) as one prototypical application, we illustrate our recent progress in two broad areas of current CRE-interest, viz., the development of: 1. Improved rate laws/transport coefficients for next-generation Eulerian, multi-(state) variable population-balance formulations, and 2. Quadrature-based multi-variate moment methods (hereafter QMOM) suitable for articulation with evolving Eulerian CFD simulation methods Admittedly, in previous work much insight was obtained by introducing deliberately (over-) simplified rate laws (for nucleation, Brownian coagulation, vapor growth/evaporation, sintering, thermophoresis,...) into the generally nonlinear integro-partial differential equation called the 'population balance' equation (PBE). However, despite the complexity of this equation, and the need to satisfy it along with many other local PDE-balance principles in multi-dimensional CRE environments, in our view current requirements for reactor design, as well as the frequent need to infer meaningful physico-chemical parameters based on laboratory measurements on populations rather than individual 'particles', make the introduction of more accurate rate/transport laws essential for next-generation particle synthesis reactor models. Our present examples are motivated both by measurements/calculations of the structure of laminar counterflow flames synthesizing Al2O3 nps and/or the predicted performance of well-mixed steady-flow devices in which sintering or sublimation occurs. Corresponding illustrative results, which focus on the rate laws for sphere dissolution or aggregate Brownian coagulation support our contentions that: i) systematic introduction of more accurate rate laws (including nucleation, sintering, growth,...)/transport coefficients will be essential to meet the quantitative demands of next-generation PBE-based CRE-simulation models for high-value particulate synthesis equipment, and, ii) QMOM is able to incorporate realistic rate laws and faithfully generate their effects on important 'moments' characterizing the product joint distribution functions.

ABSTRACT:
This paper concentrates on the practical implications of bifurcation and chaos on novel approaches for the production of the clean fuels: hydrogen and ethanol, and the simulation of the acetylcholine neurocycle in the brain. One problem from the field of chemical reaction engineering and two from the field of biological reaction engineering, the three problems have one thing in common: the practical implications of bifurcation and chaos. The novel approach for hydrogen production is based on a novel circulating fluidized bed catalytic membrane reformer configuration achieving, simultaneously, both autothermicity and breaking the thermodynamic barriers using different techniques (membranes and/or CO2 sequestration). The static bifurcation characteristics of the autothermic process and their implications on design and operation for maximum hydrogen yield and productivity are addressed. Experimental set-up for this novel process is being developed at University of British Columbia (UBC).
The novel approach for the ethanol production does not use a novel configuration, however it uses a classical configuration but with a novel mode of operation. A CSTR fermenter is used exploiting bifurcation and chaos theories to maximize ethanol yield and productivity. The sequence of research work consisted of: developing a reliable and relatively simple model to describe the fermentation process, verification of the model against experimental results, using the model in an extensive bifurcation and chaos analysis investigation to identify the regions of bifurcation and chaos and their characteristics. This is followed by using these results to guide an experimental investigation of bifurcation and chaos and their implications on improving ethanol yield and productivity.
This paper also introduces our preliminary efforts to investigate the bifurcation and chaotic behavior of acetylcholine neurocycle in the brain using diffusion-reaction models in order to gain some insight into their possible connection to Alzheimer and Parkinson Diseases (AD/PD).
