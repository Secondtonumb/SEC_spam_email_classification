One mans meat is another mans poison!

      You win some, you lose some A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. Age is a very high price to pay for maturity
      Well Begun is Half Done A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept.
    
    
      There is no physician like a true friend  The course of true love never did run smoothHappy is the bride the sun shines on The darkest hour is just before dawn
      Good talk saves the food Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan Cuss when yuh ah guh, nah wheh yuh ah come out. It is a long lane that has no turning 
    
  
  Distance lends enchantment to the view No matter how long a log stays in the water it does not become a crocodile Hate is like cancer slowly eating us away inside  The best things come in small packages Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft What you see in yourself is what you see in the world Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  Curiosity killed the cat. One mans meat is another mans poison!
