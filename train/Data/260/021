TIP OF THE WEEK
-----------

Nice Verbs

------------

Students, teachers & publishers seem to be obsessed with the verb 
form so we thought we might have a brief look at an aspect of verbs. 
Do you understand the following verb terms?

main/lexical verb
finite or non-finite verb
auxiliary verb
semi-auxiliary verb
regular or irregular verbs
participles or infinitives
modal verb
semi-modal verb
stative or dynamic verb
transitive or intransitive verb
multi-word verb
verb phrase


A verb can be a main verb, or sometimes called a lexical verb, as 
opposed to the auxiliary verbs such as 'have', 'be', 'do' & the 
modals. But how can you tell the difference between the two types?

There is a nice way to tell the difference with the NICE test. Have
a look at the following chart:


The NICE test to show the component parts of auxiliary verbs

N - Negation
Auxiliary verbs form the negative with 'not' or the contracted form 
'n't' - aren't, may not, don't...

I - Inversion
When forming questions they are inverted with the preceding word - 
Are you tired? Oct I go?

C - Code
A form of ellipsis is possible with auxiliaries, they can be left 
on their own when the main verb has been left out - Ben works here 
but John doesn't. 

E - Emphasis
They can be used for emphasis - Josh does play every day.


There are also other multi-part combinations that are considered 
'semi-auxiliaries' as they come before the main verb, 'supposed to' 
- He's supposed to go.' 'be going to' - He's going to go. 'used to' 
- He used to come here. 

All of this might well be confusing for some nationalities with no 
apparent rhyme or reason behind our use of verbs. It can get sticky 
when asked by a low level class what 'do' means in a question like 
'Do you want to go?'. Sometimes referred to as the 'dummy 'do'', we 
need to get over the idea of a nuts & bolts word, one with no inherent 
meaning, present to help the main verb. A simple discrimination task 
would help to sort out the difference. Give a list of sentences with 
'do' as the main verb & as a dummy operator & the students put them 
into the two groups. Another way to show the different forms of verb 
patterns is with cuisenaire rods. Have a look at the example page on 
the site:
http://syl.v1mc2mj5em4a7l262n.com/newsletterplans\cuisenaire_9vx2.r9y

odals are also auxiliaries & they do provide meaning, which we'll 
look at in a later Tip. 

For effective communication, our students need to manipulate auxiliaries 
in the different verb forms, in tags & for emphasis & need regularly 
reminding of their use - clear presentations, noticing activities & 
regularly picking up on in feedback slots all help. Although there are 
very regular rules of form, it's easy to underestimate the difficulty 
students have with them.

For a look at multi-word verbs, see the Tip 'Sorting them out' at:
http://syl.v1mc2mj5em4a7l262n.com/tips/1l3x15wf4b.r9y
