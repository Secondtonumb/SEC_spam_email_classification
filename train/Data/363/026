Christmas comes but once a year, but Hallmark makes sure it lasts three months Water that has been begged for does not quench the thirst Fair exchange is no robbery  Love is the strangest thing The eyes speak as much as the mouth

 The best things in life are free April is the cruellest month Two's company, three's.. the musketeers. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch.
