Vancouver, British Columbia, June 05, 2006 (Prime Zone) - As part of the commitment of F alcon Ener gy, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, to keep investors informed of its status and activities, the company is providing this investor update.

Gas production continues steadily from F alcon En ergy's Richmount Westlock property in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since the well was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed over 10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range. The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue for the company and its shareholders.

Falc on E nergy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed addition of its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will be forthcoming.
