  VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 9, 2006--Falcon Energy, Inc. 
  (Pinnk Sheeets:2wv2.67 - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired 
  the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region 
  of Wedgolia. Management felt that the opportunity presented by these properties 
  was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource 
  company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant 
  Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties. 
  Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held 
  include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well 
  as Fluorite and Uranium.
  
  Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount Westlock property 
  in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and 
  investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since the well 
  was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that 
  time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed over 
  10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range. 
  The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue 
  for the company and its shareholders.

  the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will

  Gut No Fish Till You Get Them Talk is cheap Look good, feel good The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. He who pays the piper calls the tune  Penny wise, pound foolish My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you A stitch in time saves nine. 
  You have to be in it to win it Anybody can make history Only a great man can write it  Finders keepers, losers weepers It is in vain to cast your net where there is no fish  Make hay while the sun shines Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.When the student is ready, the master will appear  One of these day is none of these days. The early bird catches the worm Every flow hath its ebb Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea . 
  If in doubt, mumble Only time will tell Attack is the best form of defence
