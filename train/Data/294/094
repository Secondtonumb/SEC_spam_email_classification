Life begins at forty Let sleeping dogs lie United we stand, divided we fall

      Life is just a bowl of cherries. Under the thorn grow the roses  A man is judged by his deeds, not by his words. In Gates we trust. There is an exception to every rule
      Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . One mans loss is another mans gain Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  Never too old to learn
    
    
      A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse.
      Tongue nah gat teeth but he ah bite fuh true. Bread is the staff of life The country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers - japanese proverb When man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am. Well done is better than well said Some pork-knockers does only clear track fuh monkey run race. You cannot get blood from a stone 
    
  
  Idle people lack no excuses When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Exigency is the matriarch of ingenious contrivance. Make hay while the sun shines A dog who attends a flea circus most likely will steal the whole show. Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious. It takes one to know one Might is right The company makes the feast Every Soldier has the Baton of a Field Marshal in his Knapsack A lie well stuck to is as good as the truth. One foolish sheep will lead the flock Look before you leap.
