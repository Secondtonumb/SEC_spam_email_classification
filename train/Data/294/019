Dear Wedend
Before I proceed, may I humbly introduce myself to your good self. My name is 5jb.414t9u Ponde, a Sierra Leonian refugee in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. My late husband was until recently, one of the personal aides to the president Ahmed Kabba of Sierra Leone.
But since after the death of my husband, my family has been subjected to various forms of humiliation ranging from freezing of my husband's foreign assets and bank accounts to other forms of public shame and ridicule.
However before his death, my husband was able to safeguard with a very good diplomatic contact in Ghana funds amounting to US$9.8m (Nine Point Eight Milion United States Dollars).The funds were originally gotten from royalties accruing to my husband as the government representative of the Western Region Gold and Diamond Mining Operations.
I have decided to contact you because I am interested in investing this funds in your country which is investment friendly.
In view of your participation, I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance, or better still commit the fund into viable Joint Venture Projects with you.
Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds belong to me only as contained in my late husband's will. As soon as I get your consent, we will quickly move this fund to your country and finally move my family  over there as well .
If this proposal appeals to you, kindly give me your urgent response.
Thanks in anticipation of your kind cooperation
Best Regards,
James for Mother
