Apparently, with no actual motive, the boys approached the man with intentions of severely beating William Menter, appearing to be a park bum sleeping in a deep state of drunkenness. Police said that Koslow, the group’s leader, was into historical leaders and the last great leader of his time was Adolf Hitler of the Nazi Party in Germany. Supposedly, swastikas and Nazi memorabilia covered the walls in Koslow’s room. Koslow had the same view of “bums?as Hitler had of Jews. With the same mentality as Hitler, one who could play God and decide fate, Koslow and the others began to beat Menter while he was passed out on a park bench in George Washington Wedument Park. It seemed that they did not choose him because he was a Negro. They proceeded to take off one of Menter’s shoes. Mittman held him down while he struggled and the other boys began to singe his foot with lighted cigarettes. The boys then replaced Menter’s shoe and forced him to stand up. Five blocks down South Fourth Street they went. Their melancholy walk led them passed New Street, Driggs, Bedford Avenue, Berry Street, Wythe Avenue, and then to Kent avenue which they turned into. Then at South Fifth Street, they turned into the pier. Koslow and Mittman took Menter towards the water while Lieberman and Trachtenberg stayed out on South Fifth Street. It was about midnight when they reached the end of the pier. Koslow and Mittman forced Menter into the river knowing that he was unable to swim in his current state of pain and drunkenness. There was a splash and the boys scattered back to their homes.
