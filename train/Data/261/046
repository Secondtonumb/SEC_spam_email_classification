      And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. Time wounds all heels. The difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  Beauty is only skin deep
      A gossips mouth is the devils postbag. I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger  God made the country and man made the town!
    
     
      Practice makes perfect Children Have Wide Ears and Long TonguesA reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. A cat has nine lives.
