VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 05, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) - As part of the commitment of Falcon Energy, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, to keep
investors informed of its status and activities, the company is providing this
investor update.

Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount
Westlock property in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since
the well was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed
over 10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range.
The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue for the company and its shareholders.

Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed
addition of its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will be forthcoming.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct 17, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) -- Falcon Energy, Inc.
is pleased to announce that the granting of exploration licenses for five mining properties in Wedgolia has been finalized. These licenses will be held for a
minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy, Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Falcon Energy, Inc. had recently sought the mineral rights to these
significant properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals.

The five licensed areas are:

8825E - The Duhum Hujirt License Area
8454X - Tsagaan Tolgoi Copper/Gold Project
9997X - The Huld License Area
9996X - The Har Tolgoi License Area
9668X - Hutagt License Area

Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses
are held include:
Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as
Fluorite and Uranium.

Seven years nah too much fuh wash speck off ah bird neck. Your future lies before you like a field of driven snow Be careful how you tread it for every step will show If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the mountain Common fame is seldom to blame There Are No Atheists in Foxholes Birds of a feather flock together A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners. 

April is the cruellest month Give Neither Counsel Nor Salt till You Are Asked For It He who flies high is a short step from a big fall  A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  The rotten apple injures its neighbours Fine words butter no parsnips  Jack of all trades, master of none Civility costs nothing 
Flies never visit an egg that has no crack  Two things a man should never be angry at: what he can help and what he cannot help  Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left On the Turf all men are equal, and under it  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. To thine own self be true Zeal without knowledge is the sister of folly If there were no lossers there could be no winners  Lots of people confuse bad management with destiny Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. The horses of hope gallop, but the asses of experience go slowly No pain, no gain  Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you Better to be safe than.. punch a 5th grader. It is what is in the mind when sober, that comes out of the mouth when drunk 

Nothing ventured, nothing gained Dont make love at the garden gate, love is blind but the neighbours aint The first faults are theirs that commit them, the second theirs that permit them Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tear A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain. Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. A child is a person who can dismantle in 25 minutes the toy it took you 25 hours to put together. Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  
The price of greatness is responsibility He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword  Many people know how to say nothing; few know when Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway Watch your thoughts, they become words Watch your words, they become actions, watch your actions, they become habits, watch your habits, they become characer Watch your character, it becomes your destiny  Your future lies before you like a field of driven snow Be careful how you tread it for every step will show What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts Never judge someone until you have travelled a mile in their shoes
