When asked in the recent 60 Minutes interview how Hoodia
worked for her CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl said she 
had no after effects ? no funny taste in her mouth, 
no queasy stomach, and no racing heart. 

She also wasn't hungry all day, even when she'd normally 
have a pang around mealtime. She also had no desire to 
eat the entire day. 

"I'd have to say it did work," says Stahl.
