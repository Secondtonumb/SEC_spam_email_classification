Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas
decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good
mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was
to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up
through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone,
watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow,
all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the
opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing.
When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around
lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.
Around six oclock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started
screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had
come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the
wall of Buckbeaks room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry
he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock
when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.Hi,
