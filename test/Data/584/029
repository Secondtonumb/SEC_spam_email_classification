      Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  One good turn deserves half the blankets Let sleeping dogs lie. A man is known by the company he keeps. 
      Gut No Fish Till You Get Them Better die with honor than live with shame Nobody want dutty powder. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. Plant the crab tree where you will, it will never bear pippins 
    
    
      The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing A crowd is not company. No man is an island
      Don't cross your bridges before you come to them. A cat may look at a Queen. Distance lends enchantment to the view To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart  
    
  
  Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line.Share and share alike! To know the road ahead, ask those coming back All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Laughter is the closest distance between two people A change is as good as a rest. Old fish and young flesh feed men best All good things come to those who wait. Belly full behind drunk. Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget Knowing is not enough; We must Apply Willing is not enough; We must Do
