      If in doubt, mumble A chat has nine lives.. To whom God gives, to him also the people give 
      To have is to hold and to hold is to have A proverb never lies, it is only its meaning which deceives. Always the bridesmaid,never the bride 
    
     
      Barking dogs seldom bite Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their meat.He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty
      But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. Patience is a virtue Don't cross your bridges before you come to them. All good things come to those who wait. A cat may look at a Queen. 
    
  
  What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts Rats desert a sinking ship.He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill! Grease is the only cure for a hangover Don't put all your hypes in one home page. Happy is the bride the sun shines on A fool gives; a wise man takes. A celebrity is someone who works hard all his life to become known and then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognized.  What flares up fast, extinguishes soon
