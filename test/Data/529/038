  VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 9, 2006--Falcon Energy, Inc. 
  (Pinnk Sheeets:2wv2.67 - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired 
  the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region 
  of Wedgolia. Management felt that the opportunity presented by these properties 
  was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource 
  company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant 
  Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties. 
  Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held 
  include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well 
  as Fluorite and Uranium.
  
  Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount Westlock property 
  in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and 
  investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since the well 
  was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that 
  time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed over 
  10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range. 
  The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue 
  for the company and its shareholders.
  
  Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed addition of 
  its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding 
  the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will 
  be forthcoming.

  A person who can smile when things go wrong has found someone to blame it on.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Love conquers all I have found at my age going bra-less pulls all the wrinkles out of my face.  And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. The pen is mightier than the.. pigs. After all is said and done, more is said than done  Gentle is that gentle does  You cannot lose what you never had How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Every bird loves to hear himself singFor the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. Why bark when you can get a dog to do it  
  He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  Man strength deh ah he hand, woman strength deh a she mouth. For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD. It takes one bad apple to spoil the barrel! Fine feathers make fine birds Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity A child is a person who can dismantle in 25 minutes the toy it took you 25 hours to put together. To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. Better to remain silent and appear a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt  Laughter is the best medicine A man is known by the company he keeps. 
  Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice
