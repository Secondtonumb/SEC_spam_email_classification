1. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Vendor will grant to the Company=
 the sole and exclusive irrevocable right and title to the
Claims, subject to:

(i) the completion by the Company of confirmation of legal title and due =
diligence on the Properties as to ownership by the Vendor and results the=
refrom being satisfactory to the
Company, acting reasonably, within a period of 90 days;

(ii) the right to extend a further 90 days by mutual consent. (the right =
to extend a further 90 days has been granted to the Company, in an effort=
 to complete its due diligence);

(iii) The Vendor and the Company shall put forth, all their reasonable be=
st efforts to obtain a satisfactory title opinion or Court Order, or such=
 that the Company will acquire the property freee and clear of all liens =
