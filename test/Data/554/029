      There are always ears on the other side of the wall  Middle age is when broadness of the mind and narrowness of the waist change places 
      The last straw breaks the camel's back. A stumble may prevent a fall. The price of greatness is responsibility
    
    
      Nothing is certain but death and taxes Wedendship is like money,easier made than keptAll good things come to those who wait.
      Give and spend and God will send Love thy neighbour as thy self Spare the rod and spoil the child The pen is mightier than the.. pigs. You have to be in it to win it 
    
  
  It takes all sorts to make a worldIf practice makes perfect and nobody's perfect then why practice?. A Growing Youth Has a Wolf in His Belly. Blue are the hills that are far away When poverty comes in at the door, love flies out of the window  as soft as velvet The pen is mightier than the sword. Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. Facts are stubborn things as wrinkled as an elephant's hide
