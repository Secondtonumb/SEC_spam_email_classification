A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.  

  Might is right A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. If cow-man pass wild meat whah mek me must pick up am. Every cloud has a silver lining Fax is stranger than fiction. I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger  You cannot lose what you never hadTake your time and time will take you  It takes two to tango 
  Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it  Talk about things of tomorrow and the mice inside the ceiling laugh My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path. Wedkey dress e pickney till he spoil.	 A man comes from the dust and in the dust he will end - and in the meantime it is good to drink a sip of vodka.The darkest hour is just before dawn A fool and his money are soon parted. Honesty is the best policy The early bird catches the worm. Hope springs eternal  
  Pardon all but theyself All is for the best in the best of the possible worlds In for a penny, in for a pound A lender nor borrower be.  Angry Men Make Themselves a Bed of NettlesFortune favours the brave A wise head keeps a still tongue. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway If dutty ah deh ah roof tap, yuh barrel ah catch am. Two sides of the same coin. When water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. 
  Charity begins at home A fool at forty is a fool indeed.To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. An apple a day keeps the doctor at bay It is nice to be important but it is more important to be nice Let the buyer beware There is no jollity but hath a smack of folly The spirit is willing but the flesh is weakHistory repeats itself 
  So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. The more the merrier  Don't cross your bridges before you come to them. Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . As you sow, so shall you reap Great oaks from little acorns growHonesty is the best policy One of these days is none of these days. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. 
  Good fences make good neighbours! Seven years nah too much fuh wash speck off ah bird neck. Hard work never did anyone any harm  A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept. Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain and most fools do Pentium wise; pen and paper foolish.After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box Fair exchange is no robbery  God made the country and man made the town! He Lives Long Who Lives Well Jack of all trades, master of none 
  Civility costs nothing The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Better an open enemy, than a false friendRain ah fall ah roof yuh put barrel fuh ketch am. After a famine in the stall comes a famine in the hall  Under the thorn grow the roses  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The horses of hope gallop, but the asses of experience go slowly 
  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
