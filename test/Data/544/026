This letter may seem strange I can provide irrefutable 
proof about all I have written. Read this with an open mind, verify 
what I have written independently if you wish and get back to me.

I am 
Mr. Brian Benjamin the manager of Auditing and Accounting department of 
Fidelity bank of Africa. In my department, we discovered an abandoned 
sum of US$60 Million dollars (sixty million dollars in an account that 
belongs to one of our foreign customers g4.3bbkmdm schranner of Munich, 
Germany) who died along with his entire family and son in-law and 
family in July 2000 in a plane crash. For more information about the 
crash visit this site

I need someone with a foreign account to be able to receive this 
money, even an empty account can serve to claim this money. Should you 
be willing to complete this transaction, send to me your private 
telephone for easy and effective communication and location.

Upon 
receipt of your reply, I will give you more details on this transaction

Yours Faithfully

Mr. Brian Benjamin
