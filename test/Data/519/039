Investment Plan


Please read!

In April 2003, Staff Sergeant Kenneth 
Buff of the United States Army found US$160 million hidden by fleeing 
members of the Baath Party led by former dictator Saddam Hussein of 
Iraq. Later, a search of the area revealed more hidden loot, totaling 
US$650
million in all! For a detailed account of the money found by the 
US Soldiers, please click on the following website:

Last week, during a 
routine archaeological excavation of the area east of Tigris River, I 
discovered 25 boxes of the similar kind found by US Army! After careful 
examination Idiscovered that it is $100 US Dollars notes totaling USD 
7Million which I concealed personally and packaged in one box hidden 
safely at my place of residence.

I need foreign help! Can you help me? 
I do not have any foreign contacts. I will therefore appreciate your 
help to move this money abroad for investment. If you are interested, 
please reply urgently so that we can conclude the plan to move this 
money. It will be 100% risk free! You will not be required to travel to 
Iraq. Rather I can send it to you via diplomatic courier service 
through special arrangement to your country for you to clear and 
collect and proceed for subsequent lodgment of the money into your 
designated account pending my arrival as time can permit me.

May Allah 
bless you!
Regards,
Samir Abou Rabia
