International Commercial
Bank  Ghana,
first light branch.

Greetings to you.

I got your contact during my search for a reliable, honest and a trust  worthy person to entrust this huge transfer project with. My name is  g4.nbc85 Owusu. I am the manager of the International Commercial Bank  Ghana, first light branch. I am a Ghanaian married with two kids.

I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of Us$2,550.000.00. This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I  am the manger made as profit during the last year. I have already  submitted an approved end of the year report for the year 2005 to my head office here in Accra and they will never know of this excess. I have since then, placed this amount of us$2,550.000.00 on a suspense account without a beneficiary.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money  thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money  into your bank account. I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while  70% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It's going to be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I  need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund.

If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response.

Please kindly reply with this email: 4k0xb3lpbs@o9pgh90pm2.com

With regards,

Mr. Ahmed Owusu.
