VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 05, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) - As part of the commitment of Falcon Energy, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, to keep
investors informed of its status and activities, the company is providing this
investor update.

Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount
Westlock property in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since
the well was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed
over 10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range.
The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue for the company and its shareholders.

Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed
addition of its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will be forthcoming.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct 17, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) -- Falcon Energy, Inc.
is pleased to announce that the granting of exploration licenses for five mining properties in Wedgolia has been finalized. These licenses will be held for a
minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy, Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Falcon Energy, Inc. had recently sought the mineral rights to these
significant properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals.

The five licensed areas are:

8825E - The Duhum Hujirt License Area
8454X - Tsagaan Tolgoi Copper/Gold Project
9997X - The Huld License Area
9996X - The Har Tolgoi License Area
9668X - Hutagt License Area

Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses
are held include:
Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as
Fluorite and Uranium.

Life is just a bowl of cherries Accidents will happen in the best regulated families. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. All cassava get same skin but all nah taste same way. Great oaks from little acorns grow A golden key opens all doors.  A man is at his tallest when he stoops to help a child. 

Faith will move mountains Anybody can make history Only a great man can write it  There is safety in numbers Promises are like babies Easy to make, hard to deliver It is good to have company in misery Happiness is not a state of mind, but a manner of travelling  He travels fastest who travels alone  A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men. No matter how long a log stays in the water it does not become a crocodile  Keep your chin up Laughter is the best medicine.

A Deaf Husband and a Blind Wife are Always a Happy Couple. The older the fiddler, the sweeter the tune. A gentleman without an estate is a pudding without suet.  Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught Whah hurt eye does mek nose run water. Life is like a horse race there are winners and losers Life is one long catwalk 
If the Blind Lead the Blind, Both Shall Fall Into the Ditch Fine feathers make fine birds As you make your bed, so must you lie in it Out of sight, out of mind Live to the point of tears All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest  Marry in haste, and repent at leisure A golden key opens all doors.  You're never too old to learn.
