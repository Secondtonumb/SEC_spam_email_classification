It rains outside,
But it gets burnt inside.
It's cloudy outside,
But it's sunny inside.
Nothing's gonna stop,
The warmth flows out from my heart.
Careless whispers,
Either come out from his mouth,
Or fly through my wet lips,
Without any hesitation.
Let fly the wings in your hearts,
Hover in the blue sky freely,
And explore deeper in the universe£¬
Careless whispers,
Fulfill every corner.
Come on,guys!
