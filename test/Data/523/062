http://k6n611.q6gyn.com/WebObjects/8se45md.598/wa/viewAlbum?id=130012644&s=143441&v0=nmt
Ben Harper's Both Sides Of The Gun is an 18-song album that consists of two distinct moods inspired by his personal life and this year's headlines. Nine songs comprise the "peace" tracks, which are mournful, reflective, and intimate. The other half consists of the "war" tracks, which are aggressive, confrontational, and accusatory. And as usual, rock, funk, soul, and folk all infuse his music.
