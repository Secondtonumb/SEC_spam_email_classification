      A miss is as good as a.. Mr.. Kill two birds with one stone Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance. 
      Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. Birds of a feather flock together Your day starts with what you say to yourself 
    
    
      The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. Fools rush in where angels fear to treadFate leads the willing but drives the stubborn Look before you leap.
      A little of what you fancy does you good.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Be just before you are generous If you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher  Laughter is the best medicine 
    
  
  Any port in a storm The Family That Prays Together Stays TogetherGive Neither Counsel Nor Salt till You Are Asked For It Facts are stubborn things Tomorrow never comes You can't teach an old dog new tricks. The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait Live to the point of tears A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor.
