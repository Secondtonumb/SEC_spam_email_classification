If you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher  In for a penny, in for a pound.

      All good things come to those who wait. For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. You cannot lose what you never had Once seen never forgotten
      The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it Grease is the only cure for a hangover He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill! Time and tide wait for no man.
    
    
      Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it Quality is better than quantity  A good tree brings forth good fruit.
      God is alive and well and working on something less ambitious Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred  The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory  
    
  
  Fools seldom differ. All good things must come to an endLet thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. No one grows old by living; only by losing interest in living Never judge a book by its cover Sleep is better than medicine You cannot make bricks without straw  A drowning man will clutch at straws. Take a hair of the dog that bit you A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
