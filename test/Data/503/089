Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. A drowning man will clutch at straws. A worry shared is a worry halved.
 Greedy folks have long arms  For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.
