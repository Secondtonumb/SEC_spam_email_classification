Dear Grandma,

We are all doing well. I hope you are healthy and doing well also.

I'm glad that your trip to Russia was safe. It sounds like a  
wonderful place. I would like to go there someday. I have only read  
about St. Petersburg in the history book and learned about it in  
class. I had no idea that it is northern enough to experience what  
they call the "white night."

I miss you and Grandpa as well. I wish Jasmine and I had gone to  
China this summer. I miss it very much.

I cannot wait to see you again.

Summer has already started and it getting very hot.
Jasmine has begun to swim again.
