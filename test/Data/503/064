      A creaking door hangs longest. To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world  Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash.
      If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick  A faithful friend is a medicine for life. Good people are scarce
    
    
      The devil find work for idle hands to do When coconut fall from tree he can't fasten back.Distance makes the heart grow fonder You have to understand, somethings you will never understand 
      He who awaits much receives little Teaching of others teacheth the teacher All that glisters is not gold  A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight. 
    
  
  He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.You can lead a horse to water but.. how?. Every fowl feed pon he own craw. Youth nah ah weary but he ah fall down. After a storm comes a calm. A stitch in time saves nine . Love conquers all Imagination is the highest kite you can fly When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise Faith will move mountains
