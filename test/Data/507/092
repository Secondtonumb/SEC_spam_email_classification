VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 05, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) - As part of the commitment of Falcon Energy, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, to keep
investors informed of its status and activities, the company is providing this
investor update.

Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount
Westlock property in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since
the well was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed
over 10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range.
The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue for the company and its shareholders.

Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed
addition of its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will be forthcoming.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct 17, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) -- Falcon Energy, Inc.
is pleased to announce that the granting of exploration licenses for five mining properties in Wedgolia has been finalized. These licenses will be held for a
minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy, Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Falcon Energy, Inc. had recently sought the mineral rights to these
significant properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals.

The five licensed areas are:

8825E - The Duhum Hujirt License Area
8454X - Tsagaan Tolgoi Copper/Gold Project
9997X - The Huld License Area
9996X - The Har Tolgoi License Area

Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses
are held include:
Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as
Fluorite and Uranium.

 ...............................
Christmas comes but once a year Gluttony kills more than the sword  If Wishes Were Horses, Beggars Would Ride Seldom seen, soon forgotten A short absence quickens love, a long absence kills it. Things are not always what they seem. Nah every crab hole get crab.	
A Deaf Husband and a Blind Wife are Always a Happy Couple. Strike while the.. bug is close. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. The tide never goes out so far but it always comes in again  Children Have Wide Ears and Long Tongues Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  
A hedge between keeps friendship green. Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. Give a clown a finger and he will take your hand  Strangers are just friends you have not met yet Every Cook Praises His Own Broth It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive Borrowed Garments Never Fit Well The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly The Family That Prays Together Stays Together The best advice is found on the pillow Everything comes to him who waits Never judge someone until you have travelled a mile in their shoes


A problem shared is a problem halved. The tide never goes out so far but it always comes in again  A bus is a vehicle that runs twice as fast when you are after it as when you are in it. All sunshine makes a desert  One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold seven for a secret not to be sold Eight for heaven nine for hell and ten for the devils own cell Facts are stubborn things A proverb never lies, it is only its meaning which deceives. God defend me from my friends; from my enemies I can defend myself 

Danger can never be overcome without taking risks  Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. A short absence quickens love, a long absence kills it. Work expands so as to fill the time available No Good Building Without a Good Foundation Time and tide wait for no man. He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount Speak when you are spoken to
