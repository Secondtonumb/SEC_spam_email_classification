      If you educate a man you educate an individual but if you educate a woman you educate a family  Rats desert a sinking ship. It is what is in the mind when sober, that comes out of the mouth when drunk  Absence makes the heart grow fonder. God gives every bird its food, but does not always drop it into the nest  Life is like a horse race there are winners and losers
      Live and let live The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Softly, softly, catchee monkey  Nah every big head get sense.
    
     
      The Family That Prays Together Stays TogetherIts a wise child that knows its own father Great groups from little icons grow.
      What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Forbidden fruits create many jams One foolish sheep will lead the flock Stir With a Knife, Stir Up Strife He who dares wins 
    
  
  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse. He that plants a tree plants for posterity Never the twain shall meet There's no place like 9ycc.com!. A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds. Good people are scarce Never choose bedlinen or a wife by candlelight  A man's reach should exceed his grasp. Under the thorn grow the roses  Dump husband in September, you have to get rid of the spiders What you see in yourself is what you see in the world
