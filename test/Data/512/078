Winding process for production of tubes consisting of mineral wool - Project NO. 965999

Project description
A larger international company wishes to establish a cooperation with a company or a knowledge centre that has experience with equipment/method for winding a high quality short fibered wool material on a mandrel to make a tube consisting of a fine laminated wool structure with a high degree of concentricity in the plaiting (lamination) and a high degree of circular roundness on the inner side of the tube.

The material that has to be winded/coiled consists of mineral wool with a fibre thickness of averagely 3-5 my and a fibre length of averagely 3-5 mm. Each single fibre in the mineral wool is incidentally directed. This is current for all 25 dimensions. Furthermore the mineral wool is added a binder (about 25 %, Phenol resin). The Winded/coiled tubes are cured at a temperature of about 200? C.

To day the company produces the tubes in question on an existing production plant, but in order to improve the properties of the tubes it is important to create a winder process with subsequent thermal curing of the tubes that results in a considerable improvement of the above-mentioned properties of the cured tubes:
-	a high degree of concentricity in the plaiting (lamination).
-	a high degree of circular roundness on the inner side of the tube. 

The winding/curing process shall produce tubes with a density of about. 90 kg/m3 (+/-10%).

The tubes are produced in lengths of 100 cm with dimensions within the following limits:
-	Inside diameter: 25 - 80 mm
-	Thickness of material: 25 - 40 mm

The company demands a winder process with a subsequent curing process that can make allowance for the above-mentioned quality improving properties. An existing machine equipment that either direct or with modifications can make the process will be of interest, but also processes that can be realised based on fitted process technical ideas and experiences will be of interest for evaluation of the best fitted solution for the purpose.
