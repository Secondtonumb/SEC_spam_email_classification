      A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Not to know is bad; not to wish to know is worse  Beggars and borrowers cannot be choosers
      Kill two birds with one stone Ask a silly question and you get a silly answer The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat A bus is a vehicle that runs twice as fast when you are after it as when you are in it.
    
    
      Gluttony kills more than the sword  Every body wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to dieGreat minds think alike, simple minds cant think of anything different Bad news travels fast
      Out of the frying pan and into the fire . Every best friend get a next best friend. Practice what you preach  Rats desert a sinking ship All roads lead to Rome Prevention is better than cure. 
    
  
  There is illumination at the termination of the subterranean excavation.Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit. One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters. Fish are no respectors of human boredom, so why go angling Wedkey dress e pickney till he spoil.	 Nothing is certain but death and taxes A new broom sweeps clean. Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. Catch not at the shadow and lose the substance Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, cry and.. you have to blow your nose.
