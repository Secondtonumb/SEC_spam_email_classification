Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere  Nothing succeeds like success

      In for a penny, in for a pound. Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . Things can only get better
      Cold hands, warm heart  Nothing succeeds like success Keep your chin up The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything
    
    
      There is a time and a place for everythingKeep your chin up
      He that plants a tree plants for posterity The more the merrier  Good and quickly seldom meet  To err is human, to forgive divine If oil ah float watah deh ah battam.	 Virtual reality is its own reward. 
    
  
  If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport. Curses, like chickens, come home to roostJustice delayed is justice denied. What flares up fast, extinguishes soon Bitter pills may have blessed effects All good things come to those who wait. Lightning never strikes twice in the same place There is no accounting for taste
