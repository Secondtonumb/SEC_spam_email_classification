      There is safety in numbers To say that a man cannot love one woman at a time is ridiculous It is like saying a musician needs more than one violin to play the same piece of music
      The pot calls the kettle black Fruit out of season, sorrow out of reason Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone Things can only get better
    
     
      Never too old to learnDaddies know best In for a penny, in for a pound
      The devil tempts all, but the idle man tempts the devil It is never too late to be what you might have been  Have you ever noticed? anybody going slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac If trousers say massah teef, yuh can't doubt am. You cannot get blood from a stone 
    
  
  He that knows nothing, doubts nothingA bad workman blames his tools. To many people in a dustbin means there not much room in side To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. One years seeding means seven years weeding There's no fool like an old fool. True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls  Little things please little minds Dog buy rum, cow drink am, hog in sty get drunk.
