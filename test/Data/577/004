You can't teach an old dog new tricks. 

  Handsome is as handsome does When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. Prevention is better than cure Absence makes the heart grow fonder. A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. Love conquers all A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels.Never put your tongue on an iceberg In April,a youg mans thoughts turn to fancy! 
  The devil tempts all, but the idle man tempts the devil Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it  Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain and most fools do Absence makes the heart go wander. All good things must come to an end Be just before you are generousOne foolish sheep will lead the flock The Ass Loaded With Gold Still Eats Thistles Better die with honor than live with shame Everyone must row with the oars he has. Home is where you hang your @. Seeing is believing 
  You cant buy love  One mans meat is another mans poison! Abundance, like want, ruins many. All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest First things first  If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way. Age before beauty Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl A best friend is like a four leaf clover, Hard to find and lucky to have. Wasteful man money ah guh like butter in de sun. 
  A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere  You can only go as far as you push He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  Do as I say, and not as I do Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. Football is a game of two halvesA new broom sweeps clean. 
  A good conscience is the best divinity. Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy  Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground  Fine feathers make fine birds In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed A stitch in time saves nine. All good things come to those who wait.If dutty ah deh ah roof tap, yuh barrel ah catch am. Modulation in all things. 
  Cow deh a pasture he nah remember seh dog and butcher deh till he see am. You cannot lose what you never had No wind, no waves True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way. One years seeding means seven years weeding Nah because dog ah play with yuh he nah bite yuh. 
  He Who Keeps Company with the Wolf Will Learn How to Howl You might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb As safe as houses In for a penny, in for a pound.Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left Two heads are better than one Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy  A good beginning makes a good ending. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth They that dance must pay the fiddler 
  A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men. No matter how long a log stays in the water it does not become a crocodile
