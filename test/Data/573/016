Every body wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die Water that has been begged for does not quench the thirst

      Better late than never Oh, what a tangled Web site we weave when first we practice. A baby is an alimentary canal with a loud voice at one end and no responsibility at the other.
      Things that come to those who wait may be things left by those who got there first  Happy the bride who.. gets all the presents. Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble 
    
    
      Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it  Seldom seen, soon forgottenNever judge by appearences
      Wedends are made by many acts - and lost by only one  Be a good sport - wherever you go  Greedy folks have long arms  He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword  
    
  
  Business before pleasureTry praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice A guilty conscience needs no accuser.  Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. A man is known by the company he keeps. Good gubby nah ah float ah tap. The best advice is found on the pillow It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.
