Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all

      The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat It is good to be knowledgeable, but better to be lovable 
      When alone, we have our thoughts to watch, in our families, our tempers and in society our tongues Once a word leaves your mouth, you cannot chase it back even with the swiftest horse
    
    
      Do right and fear no man  You cant buy love Greedy folks have long arms 
      One good turn deserves another Christmas comes but once a year, but Hallmark makes sure it lasts three months In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed The difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  
    
  
  First things first  Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongsHalf a loaf is better than none. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Too many cooks spoil the broth It takes all sorts to make a world Better late than.. pregnant. All good things come to those who wait. Cat foot soft but he ah scratch bad.
