The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him Be just before you are generous 

  The pen is mightier than the sword. A worry shared is a worry halved. Fools seldom differ. Windows will never cease. If in doubt, mumble A cat may look at a king.Yuh can't drink mauby and belch beer. 
  He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity  The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything Never be afraid to sit awhile and think As you make your bed, so must you lie in it An apple a day keeps the doctor at bay For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. 
  Variety is the spice of life Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife Blood is thicker than water The price of greatness is responsibility I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger Good and quickly seldom meet  Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep All are not cooks that walk with long knives Let sleeping dogs lie Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. Blethers say nought 
  An idle mind is.. the best way to relax.Better safe than sorry When two big bottle deh ah table lil one nah business deh. Revenge is a dish best served cold. A danger foreseen is half avoided. He who laughs last laughs longest It is a long lane that has no turning Know what to expect before you connect.We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain  Common fame is seldom to blame 
  A miss is as good as a.. Mr.. He who does not honour his wife dishonours himself To err is human, to forgive divine Any port in a storm Be a good sport - wherever you go  Fools seldom differ. Nah everything scholar know he learn from teacher.Better to be safe than sorry Windows will never cease. Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  Some pork-knockers does only clear track fuh monkey run race. 
  A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret. Blood is thicker than water The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Great minds think alikeIt is better to travel hopefully than to arrive Patience is a virtue It nah good to shove yuh foot in every stocking. He knows best what good is that has endured evil  To whom God gives, to him also the people give  
  When dog hungry he ah nyam calabash. A constant guest is never welcome.The Mills of God Grind Slowly, Yet They Grind Exceedingly Small Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see  Better late than.. pregnant. If anything can go wrong, it will A chain is no stronger than its weakest link. 
  There is safety in numbers To say that a man cannot love one woman at a time is ridiculous It is like saying a musician needs more than one violin to play the same piece of music
