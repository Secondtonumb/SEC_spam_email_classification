In the land of hope there is never any winter Love makes the world go round 

  Youth and Old Age Will Never Agree A problem is a chance for you to do your best. Hungry nah know bam-by. As useful as a chocolate fireguard (or teapot) Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. It's always darkest before.. daylight savings time.Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 
  If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport. He who pays the piper calls the tune  He knows best what good is that has endured evil  Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. First Impressions are the Most Lasting He who has once burnt his mouth always blows his soupHe that knows nothing, doubts nothing You have to understand, somethings you will never understand  Every Cook Praises His Own Broth A fool and his money are soon parted. 
  Many a true word is spoken in jest Like music to my ears Cut your coat according to your cloth If you would enjoy the fruit, pluck not the flower as delicate as a baby's eye lashes A problem is a chance for you to do your best. When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. Accidents will happen in the best regulated families. A watched pot never boils. 
  Every devil has not a cloven hoof A camel is a horse designed by a committee. Confession is good for the soul Time wounds all heels. All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest  It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. The pen is mightier than the sword. Wedlight penetrates even the thinnest crack Do as you would be done byWhen Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman 
  Don't cross your bridges before you get to them. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Home is where you hang your @. Beauty is only skin deep You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger. A gossips mouth is the devils postbag. Every Cook Praises His Own BrothGluttony kills more than the sword  Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  Curiosity killed the cat A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. 
  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day First come, first served  Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverseThe Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it The higher the tree, the sweeter the plum  The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 
  Always the bridesmaid,never the bride  If trousers say massah teef, yuh can't doubt am. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Never judge by appearencesActions speak louder than words. Walls have ears  God made the country and man made the town! Coin a phrase Many a true word is spoken in jest When two buffalo fight, it is the grass that gets hurt! Like father, like son Caught between a rock and a hard place. Corporations have neither bodies to be punished nor souls to be damned  
  Don't bite the hand that.. looks dirty. The world is full of willing people: some willing to work and some willing to let them
