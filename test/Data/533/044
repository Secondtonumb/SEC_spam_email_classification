Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught 

  If you are planning for a year - sow rice, if you are planning for a decade - sow trees, if you are planning for a lifetime - educate people Never guh a store ah night fuh buy black cloth. The best things in life are free Don't cross your bridges before you get to them. It is in vain to cast your net where there is no fish  One mans loss is another mans gain Fear lends wingsIt takes two to make a quarrel 
  Where there's a will, there's a relative. Softly, softly, catchee monkey  When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise Better die with honor than live with shame Tailors and writers must mind the fashion Everything comes to him who waits If you educate a man you educate an individual but if you educate a woman you educate a family Haste makes waste. A tidy house holds a bored woman. Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree In vino veritas  
  The first faults are theirs that commit them, the second theirs that permit them A baby is an alimentary canal with a loud voice at one end and no responsibility at the other. A stitch in time saves nine . A cat has nine lives.The rotten apple injures its neighbours A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  Never too old to learn There is an exception to every rule Facts are stubborn things 
  Time and tide wait for no manLike a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked man ruling over a helpless people Keep your powder dry  The stylus is more potent than the claymore. Death pays all debts Fair without , false within In for a penny, in for a pound. They Brag Most That Can Do the Least Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions 
  A stumble may prevent a fall. It will all come right in the wash After a storm comes a calm. A little of what you fancy does you good.  One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters. They that dance must pay the fiddler In Gates we trust. Give a clown a finger and he will take your hand  Fools and madmen speak the truthMany things are lost for want of asking  Christmas comes but once a year What you see in yourself is what you see in the world Make hay while the sun shines 
  The bigger the better. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched . Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day.Death is the great leveller Wise children have short years Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise Use it or lose it 
  If oil ah float watah deh ah battam.	 Fine words butter no parsnips He who hesitates is lost A wonder lasts but nine days. He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. Bush get ears and dutty get tongue. The geek shall inherit the earth. The e-mail of the species is more deadly than the mail. Better bend than break 
  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
