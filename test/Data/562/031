      Home is where the heart is Bread is the staff of life
      Home is where you hang your hat One beats the bush, another takes the bird
    
    
      What's good for the goose is good for the gander.Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse.
      Never speak ill of the dead  Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. If you would enjoy the fruit, pluck not the flower  
    
  
  When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  It takes all sorts to make a world Never eat an oyster unless there is an R in the month Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. A tree never hits an automobile except in self defense. Love is like a fire, it can either warm your heart or burn your house down You only live once
