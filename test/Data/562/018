      While there is life there is hope The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait People who think the world revolves around them have no sense of direction

      Experience is a wonderful thing It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again  I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.Keep your chin up Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.
