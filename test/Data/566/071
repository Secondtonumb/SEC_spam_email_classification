Harry! Harry, over here!
Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He got up
and made his way towards her through the crowded pub. He was still a few
tables away when he realised that Hermione was not alone. She was
sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could
ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter,
ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermiones least favourite
people in the world.
Youre early! said Hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down. I
thought you were with Cho, I wasnt expecting you for another hour at
least!Hi,
