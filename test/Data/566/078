Eng. Funsho Kupolokun
Gruop Managing Director 
NNPC


I am Eng. Funsho 
Kupolokun and presently the Gruop Managing Director NNPC.

I am due for 
retirement within the next few months and I need your help to claim the 
sum of US 25.5 million deposited in a floating account with a finance 
institution. In the past few years, government had approved huge sum of 
money for us to carry out researches. We therefore awarded lots of 
contracts in which we used our position to inflate some of the 
contracts. The inflated amount is deposited in a floating account 
waiting to be claimed.

As civil servants, we are not allowed to 
transfer money abroad. Infact, we cannot lay claim to such huge amount 
from the bank here. Therefore, we need you (a foreigner) to come 
forward and claim this money on our behalf. When this money comes to 
you, we shall come over for sharing and investment. We shall share the 
money as follows: 30% for you for providing assistance and 60% for us 
and 10% will be set aside for expenses that might be incured local from 
your side during the course of this d2x83nd.s59x4f take note that the 
nature of your business has nothing to do with this proposal.

The 
modality is that you will be presented as a contractor or who has 
already executed a contract and request for payment. Application for 
payment will then be made in your 1u35.2net0c8625 is already mapped out 
to avoid any hitch. There is no risk in this deal but has to be kept 
very confidential by both parties.

If 
you are interested, please do 
reply and do not hesitate to ask for further explanation if you so 
need.

Thanking you for your expected co-operation and immediate 
response.


Yours sincerely,


Eng. Funsho
