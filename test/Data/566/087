Lend your money and lose your friend 

  One foolish sheep will lead the flock Know which side your bread is buttered  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. Virtual reality is its own reward. Experience is a wonderful thing It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly 
  Every cloud has a silver lining Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Although the Wed Oct Shine, Leave Not Thy Cloak at Home You win some, you lose some There's no fool like an old fool. It never rains but it pours A constant guest is never welcome.Although the Wed Oct Shine, Leave Not Thy Cloak at Home Great oaks from little acorns grow A drowning man will clutch at straws. Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company  
  Age is a very high price to pay for maturity. . Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both Its a wise child that knows its own father Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage  Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  as soft as velvet Laughter is the best medicine. He is an ill companion that has a good memory  Every family has a skeleton in the cupboard The stick is the surest peacemaker Nowt so queer as folk! 
  A good mate is the road map for the spaghetti junction of life.Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people  To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity. Things can only get better One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold seven for a secret not to be sold Eight for heaven nine for hell and ten for the devils own cell Better to be safe than sorry Count your blessings A danger foreseen is half avoided. A golden key opens all doors. The proof of the pudding is in the eating 
  Talk about things of tomorrow and the mice inside the ceiling laugh Cold hands, warm heart  Prevention is better than cure Two wrongs do not make a right What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity A book holds a house of gold. Let sleeping dogs lie In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is KingA place for everything and everything in its place. He who hesitates is lost. 
  Waste not, want not The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds. When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  If in doubt, mumbleLet the buyer beware Only fools and horses work  A penny saved makes Jack a dull boy. 
  A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day. He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount A friend is not so soon gotten as lost.Things are not always what they seem. Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see  If you are planning for a year - sow rice, if you are planning for a decade - sow trees, if you are planning for a lifetime - educate people One good turn deserves another Only fools and horses work  And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. 
  There is an exception to every rule
