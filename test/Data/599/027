A leopard cannot change its spots. Dead men tell no tales 

  You cant buy love  Perfection is inperfect Only when all contribute their firewood can they build up a strong fire To whom God gives, to him also the people give  A person who can smile when things go wrong has found someone to blame it on.  Only when all contribute their firewood can they build up a strong fire as soft as velvet Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief In vino veritas  Modulation in all things. 
  Charity begins at home The best things come in small packages Nobody want dutty powder. To err is human, to forgive divine Take your time and time will take you  The country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers - japanese proverb A good name is better than a good face.A chain is no stronger than its weakest link. Never speak ill of the dead  If oil ah float watah deh ah battam.	 Let bygones be bygones 
  A happy heart is better than a full purse.  The stick is the surest peacemaker Opportunity makes a thief A leopard cannot change its spots. After dinner rest a while, after supper walk a mile A man is judged by his deeds, not by his words. Nah everything scholar know he learn from teacher. A user and his leisure time are soon parted. Hasty climbers have sudden falls Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions One volunteer is worth ten pressed men For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD. 
  Take your time and time will take you When two big bottle deh ah table lil one nah business deh. He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. The truth will out There's no place like 9ycc.com!. There is no such thing as a free lunch He who hesitates is lost A cat may look at a Queen.Good fences make good neighbours! 
  The pen is mightier than the sword. Time and tide wait for no man. Football is a game of two halves Many people know how to say nothing; few know when If anything can go wrong, it will What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Once a word leaves your mouth, you cannot chase it back even with the swiftest horseA problem is a chance for you to do your best. The Devil rides upon a fiddlestick St Swithins Day, if thou does rain, for forty days it will remain, St Swithins day if thou be fair for forty days twill rain no more Discretion is the better part of valour 
  When you live in the past, it costs you the present  Procrastination is the thief of time Good talk saves the food Adversity doesnt build character, it reveals it Never go to bed on an argument One foolish sheep will lead the flock God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers  The eyes speak as much as the mouth But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. 
  If you wish to be loved, love From clogs to clogs in only three generations Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea .It nah good to shove yuh foot in every stocking. The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything Children Have Wide Ears and Long Tongues A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions. Curiosity killed the cat Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep Experience is the best teacher Yuh can't chew bone with gum. You get what you give 
  Too many chiefs and not enough indians Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
