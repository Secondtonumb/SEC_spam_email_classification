Red H0t News:
Hollywood 
Intermediate Expands the Creative Palette for Independent Filmmakers 
GLENDALE, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--May 31, 2006 -- Hollywood Intermediate, Inc. A 
provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced today that 
its Matchframe Digital Intermediate division is currently providing full digital 
intermediate services for Super 16MM productions.

Hollywood Intermediate, Inc. (HYWI - News), a provider of digital intermediate 
film mastering services, announced that High Definition preview masters as part 
of its normal digital intermediate service offerings and workflow.

Typically, in current post-production workflow, HD dailies masters are edited 
into high quality preview masters including color timing, dirt removal, opticals 
and visual effects, said David Waters, Hollywood Intermediate president. 
Unfortunately, none of these processes translate to the theatrical release of 
the film as they must all be duplicated or repeated in either a higher 
resolution digital format, or photo chemical process.

Hollywood Intermediate gives Motion Picture producers the ability to scan their 
selected original camera negative at 2k or 4k film resolution, conform a high 
resolution digital master for theatrical and broadcast release including dirt 
removal, opticals and visual effects, and output a High Definition preview 
master to be used for preview screenings and focus groups that can be deployed 
in any worldwide theater location.

The challenge for completing the final editorial decisions on a motion picture 
are balanced between the ability to display the highest resolution picture for a 
test audience, and the costs and time in having to re-master your film based on 
a test audience response, said Jim Delany, Hollywood Intermediate COO.

Hollywood Intermediate offers a flexible alternative to traditional 
photochemical and video post-production processes for film mastering and preview 
screenings eliminating cost and time redundancies,We expect our 
HD preview screening master services to provide crucial workflow efficiencies 
helping Hollywood Intermediate achieve market growth in the current digital 
intermediate and high definition marketplace.

First Thing Wedday



Up one side and down the other.   Top of the morning.    A rolling stone gathers no moss. What goes down usually comes up.  Walking on cloud nine. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   Pull it up by the roots. So hungry I could eat a horse. Where man is not nature is barren. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Waking up with the chickens. A weed is no more than a flower in disguise.  A weed is no more than a flower in disguise.  Sour as a green apple.   Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. Shiver me timber.
