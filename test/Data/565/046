      The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Marry in haste, and repent at leisure The eyes are the window of the soul Divide and rule Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow 
      The geek shall inherit the earth. Where there's a will, there's a relative.

      Murder will out Charity begins at home If in doubt, mumble Pick your friends like you pick your fruit The more you get, the more you want It is better to love and lost than never to love at all Six of one, half a dozen of the other . The best things come in small packages 
    
  
  Wise children have short years Some pork-knockers does only clear track fuh monkey run race. God is alive and well and working on something less ambitiousA bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

There is no jollity but hath a smack of folly Every cloud has a silver lining
