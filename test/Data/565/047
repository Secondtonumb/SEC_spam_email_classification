To the victor the spoils  You can throw a cat however you want; it always lands on its feet  He who hesitates is lost

      One man's meat is another man's poison.. An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept 
      Misery loves company Turn the other cheek A man that breaks his word bids other be false to him. What does not kill you makes you stronger Fools seldom differ 
    
    
      A rolling stone gathers no moss.The longest day must have an end There is a time and a place for everything Confession is good for the soul
      A drop of ink may make a million think. Every rope gat two ends. Absence makes the heart go wander. Gluttony kills more than the sword  
    
  
  When you want fuh swim river yuh gat fuh plunge inside fuss. Old friends and wine are best Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. The last straw breaks the camel's back. As safe as houses Lightning never strikes twice in the same place To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart  What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity Every bush a man night time. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
