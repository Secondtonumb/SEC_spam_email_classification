Patience is a virtue No Good Building Without a Good Foundation

      Caught between a rock and a hard place. Common fame is seldom to blame Love nature , live lightly Be kind to people on the way up, you may need them when you are on your way down
      Great minds think alike Love is blind Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone
    
    
      To have is to hold and to hold is to have He who sups with the devil should have a long spoonOpportunity seldom knocks twice. Never choose bedlinen or a wife by candlelight  Every Cook Praises His Own Broth
      United we stand, divided we fall  Loving life is living life to the fullest Virtue is its own reward Never judge a book by its cover. 
    
  
  Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok.It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  There is no time like the present Without rice, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook  Dont make love at the garden gate, love is blind but the neighbours aint As you shall make your bed, so shall you..........mess it up. Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit  It takes all sorts to make a world Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger.
