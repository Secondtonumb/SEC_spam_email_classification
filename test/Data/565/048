First come, first served  He that knows nothing, doubts nothing

      What goes up must come down The company makes the feast He that plants a tree plants for posterity
      Its only rock n roll but I like it Many hands make light work Christmas comes but once a year, but Hallmark makes sure it lasts three months He that is master of himself, will soon be master of others Past cure, past care A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve. 
    
    
      A barking dog never bites. A good beginning makes a good ending.Diligence is the mother of good fortune To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
      Past cure, past care A sprat to catch a mackerel. Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. He That Teaches Himself has a Fool for his Master The Family That Prays Together Stays Together 
    
  
  Different strokes for different folk  Sleep is better than medicineWhen the wine is in, the wit is out  Some pork-knockers does only clear track fuh monkey run race. In for a penny, in for a pound. You get what you give Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left A best friend is like a four leaf clover, Hard to find and lucky to have. God made the country and man made the town! And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. Better late than never Home is where you hang your hat
