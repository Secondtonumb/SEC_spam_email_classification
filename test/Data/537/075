Jokes of the day
A blonde, a red head, and a brunette were walking on the beach when they found a magic lamp. They began rubbing it 
and genie came out and said, You each may have one wish. The red head thought for a while and said, "Even though 
blondes are stupid, they have so more fun, I wish to be blonde." and she was turned blonde. The brunette agreed, 
That's true, I really want to have more fun too, even though I'll be dumber, I wish to be blonde" and she became 
blonde also. The blonde looks at the two other blondes and said, I just don't think I have enough fun. I don't 
care if I becomer even more dumb, make me more blonde, woo! So the genie granted her wish and made her a man. 
Joke 2 
Once there was a blonde driving home from work when she saw a sheep farm. She stops and asks the farmer if she can have a sheep. The farmer says If you can count all my sheep I'll let you have any one you want. The blonde looks around her for a moment and says, You have 356 sheep.
The farmer exclaims, Wow  you're exactly right. I guess blondes really aren't dumb. Now go pick yourself out a sheep. The blonde makes her choice, picks it up, comes back to the farmer to thank him. Oh no, he says, you can't have that one." "Why not? asks the blonde, "you said I could have any sheep I wanted. And the farmer says, Ma'am, that's my dog. 
Joke 3 
Adam was walking around the Garden of Eden feeling very lonely, so God asked him, 
What is wrong with 
you? Adam said he didn't have anyone to talk to.
God said he was going to give him a companion and it would be a woman, 
This person will cook for you and wash your clothes; she will always agree with every decision you make. 
She will bear your children and never ask you to get 
up in the middle of the night to take care of them. 
"he will not nag you, and will always be the first to admit she was wrong when you've had a disagreement. 
She will never have a headache, and will freely give you love and compassion whenever needed."
Adam asked God: "What will a woman like this cost?
God said, An arm and a leg.
Adam said, That's a little steep. What can I get, say, for just a rib?
