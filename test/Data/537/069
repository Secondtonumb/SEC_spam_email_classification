Hunger is the best sauce

      Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. Lightning never strikes twice in the same place The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. Blue are the hills that are far away
      Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred  A man's home is his castle. Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. Though the wound be healed, a scar remains 
    
    
      Walls have ears Opportunity makes a thief But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
      Never judge by appearences It will all come out in the wash As useful as a chocolate fireguard (or teapot) Fair exchange is no robbery  Be just before you are generous 
    
  
  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.Love is blind. A watched pot never boils. When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way. Saying is one thing; doing another  Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches. Every body wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die Life is one long catwalk
