      Solves two beauty problems at once!
       Longevity Inc, one of America's premier anti-aging treatment companies, has succeeded at creating the first intensive eye cream to effectively combat not one but TWO of the most aggravating beauty problems...under eye dark circles and wrinkles.
      
      Contains Haloxyl AND Xirtamyl 3000
       Hydroxatone works so well at making your eyes look younger and brighter because it combines the most effective leading ingredient for reducing serious dark circles and bags, Haloxyl, with the most advanced anti-wrinkle ingredient known to science that is proven to reduce visible deep wrinkles by up to 68%, Xirtamyl 3000. You can't help but see and feel a noticeable difference after just a few weeks. 
      
      Why Dark Circles Form in the First Place
       Despite what most people think, deep, dark circles under your eyes are not primarily caused by being tired or stressed. Instead, dermatologists and plastic surgeons agree that dark circles are caused by capillaries that leak blood close to the skin's surface. When this blood begins to oxidize, it turns a bluish red color, similar to an ugly bruise. And since the skin under the eyes is very thin, this leads to the appearance of those embarrassing bags and dark circles. The more transparent your skin and the more blood that pools under it, the darker the circles appear. And what's worse, this discoloration over time can become permanent!

      Helps Reduce  Prevent Dark Circles
       In scientific studies, Hydroxatone's main active ingredient, Haloxyl is so effective because it actually helps strengthen the capillaries to help prevent them from leaking in the first place. All natural Hydroxatone Under Eye Treatment was designed to be safe and gentle enough for everyday use.
      Need Proof? 
        In a double-blind clinical trial, more than 72% of women who had serious dark circles and used Haloxyl saw an obvious visible reduction in the dark color under their eyes. These findings were confirmed using high speed laboratory photography that clearly showed a significant reduction in the appearance of the blue and red color that make up dark eye circles. 
       Having a Hard Time Finding Hydroxatone Under Eye Treatment? 
  Until now, Hydroxatone has only been available through plastic surgeons' offices in New York and Beverly Hills. But now you can experience first hand the unique results of Hydroxatones Under Eye Treatment in combating both dark circles and wrinkles without a visit to a doctor. 
       That's because the makers of the Hydroxatone Under Eye Treatment are so confident in their anti-aging technology, they are now offering it to the public with a 30-day money back guarantee...because seeing is believing and they guarantee results in less than 30-days.
