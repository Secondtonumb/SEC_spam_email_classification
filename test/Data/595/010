秋日呢喃
    ??11月11日自习偶拾，我到底想家了

And it was at that age
Poetry arrived insearch of me
I don't know,I don't know
Where it came from
From winner or a river?
I don't know how or when
No,they were not words,nor silence
But from a street I was summoned from the branches of night
Abruptly from the others
Among violent fires or returning alone
There I was without a face and it touched me
I did not know what to say
My mouth had no way with names
My eyes were blind and something started in my soul
Fever or forgotten wings
And i made my own way deciphering that fire
And i wrote the first faint line
Faint without substance
Pure nonsense,pure wisdom of someone who knows nothing
And suddenly I saw the heavens unfastened
And open planets palpitating plantations
Shadow perforated riddled with arrows,fire and flowers
The winding night,the universe
And infinitesimal being drunks with the great starry void
Lightness image of mystery felt myself a pure part of the abyss
I wheeled with the stars
My heart broke loose on the wind

秋凉的清晨，鸟儿在林间啼啭
故乡的香樟林，脉脉的香惊扰我的梦
我在秋日的阳光中醒来，听一首小诗
香樟叶红了，飘落风中，是双飞的蝴蝶

秋风起，风铃幽幽的哼唱
唱一曲“归去来兮”，唱一曲“梦醒不知归处”
归处，归处，家在何方，梦醒何处
寻梦，寻梦，寻一掊骄阳，寂寞天涯路
