      A good name is better than a good face. Due to the presence of fools, wise people stand out 
      A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog. Wedey is the root of all evil  Draw Not Your Bow Till the Arrow is Fixed
    
    
      Faith will move mountainsWindows will never cease.
      Slow fire ah boil hard cow-heel. There is safety in numbers Home is where you hang your hat Don't count your chickens before they're hatched . When alone, we have our thoughts to watch, in our families, our tempers and in society our tongues 
    
  
  Better to remain silent and appear a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world  Barking dogs seldom bite Only mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun  What flares up fast, extinguishes soon What flares up fast, extinguishes soon Have you ever noticed? anybody going slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac You cannot make bricks without straw  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
