You see the problem, said Lupin. While the Ministry insists there is
nothing to fear from Voldemort its hard to convince people hes back,
especially as they really dont want to believe it in the first place.
Whats more, the Ministrys leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to
report any of what theyre calling Dumbledores rumour-mongering, so most
of the wizarding community are completely unaware any things happened,
and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if theyre using
the Imperius Curse.
But youre telling people, arent you? said Harry, looking around at Mr
Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin and Tonks. Youre letting people
know hes back?
They all smiled humourlessly.Hi,
