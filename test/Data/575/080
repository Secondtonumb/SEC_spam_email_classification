Quickly come, quickly go A disposition towards inquiry deprived the feline of its vital state. 

  Elementary sartorial techniques initially applied obviate the need for repetitive similar actions to the square of three. One of these days is none of these days Practice makes perfect. A wonder lasts but nine days. Little things please little minds There are two sides to every question Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. Lend your money and lose your friendFools rush in where angels fear to tread If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. 
  Nothing is interesting if you are not interested  Rain before seven, fine before eleven  Once a word leaves your mouth, you cannot chase it back even with the swiftest horse Its too late to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow  The pot calls the kettle black A good conscience is the best divinity.Look before you leap The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit  Bees that have honey in their mouths have stings in their tails A faithful friend is a medicine for life. Yuh can't suck cane and blow whistle. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. 
  Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  It takes two to tango True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls  Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their meat. When good cheer is lacking, our friends will be packingThose who play the game do not see it as clearly as those who watch Never look a gift horse in the mouth Nah tek yuh mattie eye fuh see. One mans loss is another mans gain Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself Fish ah play ah sea, he nah know watah ah boil fuh am. 
  A friend in need is a friend indeed. Love nature , live lightlyNever look a gift horse in the mouth Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage  Life is like a drawing pin - sharp at one end, and flat at the other All sunshine makes a desert  What boots up must come down. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway Too much sit down ah bruck trousers.Chaste makes waste. 
  Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their meat. as soft as velvet One mans loss is another mans gain To err is human, to forgive divine Live to the point of tears Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit  Love thy neighbour as thy self But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.God defend me from my friends; from my enemies I can defend myself Never say die Beware of Greeks bearing gifts  
  A penny always turns up. Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred  Nah tek yuh mattie eye fuh see. I have found at my age going bra-less pulls all the wrinkles out of my face. The best things come in small packages Laughter is the closest distance between two people To the jaundiced eye all things look yellow The first step is the hardest. 
  For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil. He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you as strong as loveBlood is thicker than water Great oaks from little acorns grow If yuh eye nah see, yuh mouth nah must talk. Nothing is certain but death and taxes Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  Great minds think alike, simple minds cant think of anything different The price of liberty is eternal vigilance Better do it than wish it done Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife 
  Love thy neighbour as thy self
