-- CALL FOR PAPERS - Deadline for submissions (second call): 8 May 2006 --

              IADIS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE MOBILE LEARNING 2006 
                    14?6 July 2006 - Dublin, IRELAND 
                     (http://www.iadis.org/ml2006) 
  co-located with IADIS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE e-SOCIETY 2006
                     (http://www.iadis.org/es2006)

* Co-organised by Trinity College, Dublin

* Supported by Science Foundation Ireland

* Keynote Speakers (confirmed):
Professor Mike Sharples, University of Nottingham, UK
Professor Elliot Soloway, Arthur F. Thurnau Professor, University of Michigan, USA
Professor Cathie Norris,University of North Texas in Denton, USA

* Conference Background and Goals
Mobile Learning, although in its infancy as a research area, has to date generated much interest and discussion among researchers. In particular, financial, logistical or technical reasons, such as the ever increasing availability of wireless portable devices, have provided a rich environment for the proliferation of ‘mobile learning applications? While there is an increasing number of mobile applications and devices that offer substantial potential to support and enable learning and teaching processes, the danger of designing, developing and implementing learning application for mobile devices that are not truly anchored in sound principles of learning is something researcher in the area of mobile learning must be mindful of. 

Research and developments in the field of mobile learning have yielded numerous experiences and tools that could be broadly classified into administrative, referential, interactive, data collection, location aware and collaborative categories. While the initial categories to some extend attempt to replicate or augment applications available on fixed desktop or laptop computers, the later leverage off the unique attributes of wireless mobile devices by creating new learning opportunities which would not be possible without mobile technology.

Against this background, the Mobile Learning 2006 International Conference aims to provide a forum for presenting and discussing cutting edge mobile learning research. In particular empirical research informed by theories of learning such as collaborative, contextual, constructivist and constructionist approaches which are well suited for mobile learning experiences and scenarios, is encouraged. Furthermore, given the continuous developments in technology, the conference aims to generate speculative debate in relation to where the field may be going.  

* Format of the Conference 
The conference will comprise invited talks and oral presentations. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the form of a book. The best paper authors will be invited to publish extended versions of their papers in selected Journals, including IADIS International Journal on WWW/Internet and IEEE Distributed Systems Online ISSN: 1541-4922. 

* Types of Submissions 
Full and Short Papers, Posters/Demonstrations, Tutorials, Panels and Doctoral Consortium. All submissions are subject to a blind refereeing process. 

* Topics related to Mobile Learning are of interest. We invite researchers, practitioners, developers and all those working in the mobile learning arena to submit work under the following topics:
?Pedagogical approaches and theories for mLearning
?Collaborative, cooperative and Contextual mLearning
?Creativity and mLearning
?Gaming and simulations in mLearning
?mLearning in educational institutions: primary, secondary and third level
?Informal and Lifelong mLearning  
?mLearning in developing countries
?New tools, technologies and platforms for mLearning
?User Studies in mLearning
?The social phenomenon of mobile devices and mLearning
?Speculative ideas in mLearning: where next?

An academic conference is itself an exercise in learning. Accordingly, proposals as to how mobile technology can enhance the conference experience are invited.

* Important Dates:
- Submission Deadline (second call): 8 May 2006
- Notification to Authors (second call): until 31 May 2006
- Final Camera-Ready Submission and Registration at Early Rates (second call): Until 7 June 2006

* Conference Location 
The conference will be held in Dublin, Ireland at Trinity College.
