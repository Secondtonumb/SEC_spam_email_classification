      Business before pleasure It is good to be knowledgeable, but better to be lovable  The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth
      You are never a loser till you quit trying Better to be alone than in bad company  Better wed over the mixen than over the moor There is safety in numbers
    
    
      A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spiritImagination is the highest kite you can fly Let the buyer beware
      A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain. History repeats itself Different strokes for different folk  A new broom sweeps clean. 
    
  
  Happiness is not a state of mind, but a manner of travelling  Faint heart never won fair ladyAnd thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. He that knows nothing, doubts nothing A man is known by the company he keeps.  Christmas comes but once a year, but Hallmark makes sure it lasts three months Birds of a feather flock together If there were no lossers there could be no winners  A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. Imagination is the highest kite you can fly
