Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (FCYI - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and 1www02yr4mz8.e80rh1 Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

Sour as a green apple.   Putting the cart before the horse. What on earth? Sick as a dog.   Spring forward fall back. Survival of the fittest.   You say potayto, I say potahto. Treat him like dirt. This is for the birds.   That's water under the bridge. That's water under the bridge. The scythe ran into a stone. What goes down usually comes up.  The sharper is the berry, the sweeter is the wine. Watered down.

Put to bed with a shovel. Plant kindness and gather love.   We'll hand you out to dry. You can't teach an old dog new tricks.  Your all washed up. The scythe ran into a stone. What on earth? Take time to smell the roses. Stop, look and listen. When you get lemons, make lemonade.(When life gives you scraps make quilts.) Still water runs dirty and deep.   Spring to mind.   Up a tree. Spaceship earth.   You say potayto, I say potahto. Waking up with the chickens. Were you born in a barn? Under the weather. A tree does not move unless there is wind.   Under the weather. Thick as a brick.   A snail's pace. A snail's pace.
