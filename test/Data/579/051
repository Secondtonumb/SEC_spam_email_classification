      Every Ass Loves to Hear Himself Bray Constant dripping wears away the stone Hunger is the best sauce
      The young man thinks the old mans stupid but the old man KNOWS the young man is He who is ABSENT is always in the Wrong An English Summer, Three Hot Days and a Wednderstorm Clothes make a man
    
    
      Nobody want dutty powder. Hell hath no fury like a woman scornedKeep your powder dry  Too many cooks spoil the broth
      Seeing is believing An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  A good lawyer must be a great liar. Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. 
    
  
  Nothing ventured, nothing gainedWhen one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything It is what is in the mind when sober, that comes out of the mouth when drunk  Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  Quality is better than quantity  Agree, For The Law is Costly Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man.
