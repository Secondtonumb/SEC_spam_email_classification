      A fool and his money are soon parted. Out of sight, out of mind The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Every man has his price
      Do not look where you fell, but where you slipped  When It Rains and the Wed Shines at the Same Time the Devil is Beating his Wife Experience is better bought than taught
    
    
      A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. Strike while the.. bug is close.For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity

  Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly No man is a hero to his valet A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Nothing succeeds like success He is always right who suspects that he makes mistakes Whah hurt eye does mek nose run water. Love laughs at the locksmiths
