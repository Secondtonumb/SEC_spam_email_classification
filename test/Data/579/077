      A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway.  The pen is mightier than the.. pigs.
      All good things come to he who waits  Mind your own business Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife Fish are no respectors of human boredom, so why go angling
    
    
      Kill not the goose that lays the golden eggMany things are lost for want of asking  First things first 
      Every bird loves to hear himself sing Doubt is the beginning of wisdom. Love laughs at the locksmiths And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. Speed thrills. 
    
  
  Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thingLove is like a fire, it can either warm your heart or burn your house down as dirty as a pig It is easier to get forgiveness than permission  In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is King A stitch in time saves nine . Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. Let bygones be bygones Give a clown a finger and he will take your hand
