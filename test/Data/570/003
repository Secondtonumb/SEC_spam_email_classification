Good afternoon Dr. Hua-Cai Ge. I need again your help.  If is possible to send me the original article used for determination of DS, because it is not available at 0241139kf1j72.com. We continue with the problem, because the article present only A, but I think that probably was used A1 ou A2, at the equation, and the values are the difference of the volume between the peaks obtained?

 

Sincerely
