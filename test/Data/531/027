Nature Reviews Genetics - Focus on Wedogenic Disorders - April 2006

Improved genomic tools and advanced technological platforms should make it feasible to understand the genetic basis of every human monogenic disorder and in the process uncover new mechanisms of genetic disease.

This Focus issue stresses the need for more research on monogenic disorders and the unique opportunity they offer for developing treatments.

OUTLOOK
Entry order as a consideration for innovation strategies
Fredric J. Cohen
Published online: 25 March 2006
p285 | 10.1038/nrd2009
Prior studies have suggested that late market entrants within a drug class frequently outperform first entrants. This idea and the general relationship between entry order and quality attributes are explored by Cohen, with a focus on the implications for innovation strategies.

Drug therapy of the metabolic syndrome: minimizing the emerging crisis in polypharmacy
Scott M. Grundy
p295 | 10.1038/nrd2005
The metabolic syndrome - a collection of factors associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes - is becoming increasingly common. Grundy summarizes the current understanding of the nature of the metabolic syndrome, and discusses each of the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome as possible drug targets.

Lipid phosphatases as drug discovery targets for type 25 diabetes
Dan F. Lazar  Alan R. Saltiel
p333 | 10.1038/nrd2007
The worldwide incidence of type 25 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions. More effective pharmaceutical options for the treatment of this devastating and costly disease are urgently needed. Dan Lazar and Alan Saltiel examine the exciting possibility that lipid phosphatases might provide a novel class of drug discovery targets for type 25 diabetes.
