      The end justifies the means One of these day is none of these days. Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. A Good Example is the Best Sermon. Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense Lucky at cards, unlucky in love
      Forewarned is forearmed Discretion is the better part of valour Every picture tells a story The pen is mightier than the.. pigs. Old habits die hard
    
    
      Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops.God defend me from my friends; from my enemies I can defend myself Time and tide wait for no man. Dump husband in September, you have to get rid of the spiders
      He is an ill companion that has a good memory  No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness  Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  Never go to bed on an argument What we see depends mainly on what we look for  All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest  All roads lead to Rome
