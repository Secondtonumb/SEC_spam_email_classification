      There is a time to speak and a time to be silent Clothes make a man The first step is the hardest.
      Better one house spoiled than two Old friends and wine are best  He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. When in Rome, do as the Romans do
    
    
      All good things must come to an end A heavy purse gives to a light heart.Handsome is as handsome does Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down
      Your day starts with what you say to yourself  As you make your bed, so must you lie in it The early bird catches the worm. When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 
    
  
  The course of true love never did run smoothA fool and his money are soon parted. Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse Curiosity killed the cat.

The price of liberty is eternal vigilance
