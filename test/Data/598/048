      A scalded cat fears cold water. The eyes are the window of the soul A watched pot never boils. If dutty ah deh ah roof tap, yuh barrel ah catch am. A stumble may prevent a fall.
      Zeal without knowledge, is fire without light Civility costs nothing A soft answer turneth away wrath.
    
    
      One foolish sheep will lead the flock The Fairest Rose at Last is Withered You can have too much of a good thingWhen man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am. For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. Confidence is a plant of slow growth
      Fish and guests smell in three days A fool gives; a wise man takes. Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree Though the wound be healed, a scar remains  A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 
    
  
  Experience is the best teacher Mind your own businessA scalded cat fears cold water. Fall seven times, stand up eight  None but the wearer knows where the shoe pinches Bad news travels fast Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog. When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. Laughter is the best medicine A guilty conscience needs no accuser.
