A man that breaks his word bids other be false to him. Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from a friends forehead

      Some pork-knockers does only clear track fuh monkey run race. Waste not, want not
      A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept. Necessity is the mother of invention. Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches. A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.
    
    
      As useful as a chocolate fireguard (or teapot) Keep your chin up For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.Practice what you preach  Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  The West Wind Always Brings Wet Weather, The East Wind Wet and Cold Together, the South Wind Surely Brings Us Rain, the North Wind Blows It Back Again
      Birds of a feather flock together When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. He who awaits much receives little Better to be safe than sorry When water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. 
    
  
  A man in love is a fool, and an old man in love is the greatest fool of all. Laughter is the closest distance between two peopleA man is known by the company he keeps.  Faith will move mountains When water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. A stitch in time saves nine. He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. Cat foot soft but he ah scratch bad. Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground  If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick
