You have to understand, somethings you will never understand  To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 

  The price of greatness is responsibility Robbing Peter to pay Paul Even a clock that does not work is right twice a day  Ask no questions and hear no lies The early bird catches the worm. Business before pleasure A stitch in time saves nine. Admiration is the daughter of ignorance Fair without , false within 
  Fools seldom differ. Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  Misery loves company A friend to all is a friend to none.  Blethers say noughtOne foolish sheep will lead the flock Your day starts with what you say to yourself  Nothing ventured, nothing gained It is foolish to deal with a fool Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery 
  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. Better to be alone than in bad company Virtual reality is its own reward. Life is not all beer and skittles Nah one time a fire mek peas boil. A wise head keeps a still tongue. Live and let live Curiosity killed the cat. 
  A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. Beautiful is not what is beautiful, but what one likes All you need is love People living in glass houses should not!. No good carpenter does get good wuk bench. Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is King Rats desert a sinking ship Strangers are just friends you have not met yetThe difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  Better to be safe than.. punch a 5th grader. 
  Idle people lack no excuses  Every rope gat two ends. In for a penny, in for a pound. All roads lead to Rome God is Always on the Side of the Big Battalions A new broom sweeps clean. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread A guilty conscience needs no accuser. The pen is mightier than the sword. A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.  
  A camel is a horse designed by a committee.  If in doubt, mumble A Fool Oct Give a Wise Man Counsel. Daddies know best Life is like a horse race there are winners and losersAll roads lead to Rome Wise children have short years Laughter is the best medicine Look before you leap. More haste less speed 
  Every rope gat two ends. Cuss when yuh ah guh, nah wheh yuh ah come out. Give credit where credit is due Might is rightOpportunities always look bigger going than coming  To thine own self be true A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity  He who drinks Australian Thinks Australian A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. You can't teach an old dog new.. math. Angry Men Make Themselves a Bed of Nettles 
  Pain is temporary, victory is forever  Never play leapfrog with a unicorn
