Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi . PK - News) is pleased to announce that it has 
fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the 
mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity 
presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned 
participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held 
for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the 
mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% 
of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the 
country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and exploitation.

Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the 
anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds 
in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in 
the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such 
as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 


So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

-----------------------
You feel like a fish out of water. Where man is not nature is barren. Thick as a brick.   That's a whole new can of worms.   Wrinkled as a prune. A thorn in my side.   Throw pearls before swine. Sow dry and set wet. You throw filth on the living and flowers on the 5h21.o8g a rose on your nose. Sow much, reap much; sow little, reap little. Tossed around like a hot potato.   Stir up an ant's nest.   A rose is a rose is a rose. This is for the birds.   Your barking up the wrong tree. You say potayto, I say potahto. Stubborn as a mule.   Stop, look and listen. Still water runs dirty and deep.   The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  There may be snow on the roof, but there's fire in the belly.

You feel like a fish out of water. That's a whole new can of worms.   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. Tossed around like a hot potato.   Sitting on the fence. Were you born in a barn? Spill the beans.   A thorn in my side.   Seed money. Shiver me timber. When the cows come home.  Sour as a green apple.   Putting the cart before the horse. What on earth? Sick as a dog.   Spring forward fall back. Survival of the fittest.   You say potayto, I say potahto. Treat him like dirt. This is for the birds.   That's water under the bridge. That's water under the bridge. The scythe ran into a stone.
