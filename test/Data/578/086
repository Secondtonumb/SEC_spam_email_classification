Dear Wedend, 

I am Ennis Ibe, an undergraduate student and the only son of my father.

 My Father   is a retired civil servant in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Welfare in my country 

 During his tenure in office, he embarked on transactions that yielded him huge amounts of capital especially the multimillion dollars Rural Irrigation Project of 2004, but presently he is under   detention in   a  state prisons where he is awaiting trial on allegations of gross financial misappropriation  

As a result the government has seized all our known assets, cars, houses and known bank accounts  

After due deliberation with my mother we have decided to transfer the only reaming money[$20.5million ] which is unknown to  the authorities to a secured foreign account 

 based on trust. 

This transfer should be based on mutual trust no betrayal or blackmail.

We are ready to compensate you with 10% of this amount 

We are also prepared to sign an agreement document with you stating this conditioning

 Note that the only people who knows [or will know ]  about this money   are ,The  Manager of the Security  company where the funds are presently deposited , my father 

,my mother and  yourself and possibly a lawyer to sign the agreement paper. 

Please this is not known by our government so we intend to keep it secret. I implore you to deal with us discreetly and wholeheartedly. 

We want you to secure the funds for us pending we secure travel permit to come over to your country

Please help us

In you response kindly forward your contact details [Tel /fax # ]

 

Thanks 

Ennis Ibe
