      A proverb never lies, it is only its meaning which deceives. Life is just a bowl of cherries The country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers - japanese proverb The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him Better safe than sorry So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 
    
  
  A good tree brings forth good fruit. St Swithins Day, if thou does rain, for forty days it will remain, St Swithins day if thou be fair for forty days twill rain no moreSeldom seen, soon forgotten Take your time and time will take you  If you would enjoy the fruit, pluck not the flower  Better late than never A wise son brings joy to his father,but a foolish son grief to his mother. Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all  He who has once burnt his mouth always blows his soup A cat has nine lives.
