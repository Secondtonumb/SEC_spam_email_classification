If the wind will not serve, take to the oars Every man has his price 

  What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity Better do it than wish it done A fly will not get into a closed mouth. All that glisters is not gold  Little Strokes Fell Great Oaks Visit your aunt, but not every day of the year Better wed over the mixen than over the moorNever guh a store ah night fuh buy black cloth. War does not always decide who it right but it always decides who is left! 
  Love sees no faults. Give Neither Counsel Nor Salt till You Are Asked For It While there is life there is hope Contributed by Charon Muck, 25 Oct 2000  People who think the world revolves around them have no sense of direction Shopping is a therapy  Fight truth decay, read the bible  If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip. Practice what you preach  Revenge is sweet Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity  One, one dutty build dam. A bad penny always turns up. 
  Every rope gat two ends. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery Bitter pills may have blessed effects Fair exchange is no robbery  Rain before seven, fine before eleven Experience is better bought than taught But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. A good conscience is the best divinity. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets. Many a mickle makes a muckle A stumble may prevent a fall. Never judge a book by its cover 
  A stitch in time saves nine. Clothes make a manMerry Nights Make Sorry Days Gentle is that gentle does  He who dares wins Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. No wind, no waves Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief The pen is mightier than the sword. Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their meat. 
  Death is the great leveller Merry Nights Make Sorry Days God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing It will all come right in the wash Contributed by Charon Muck, 25 Oct 2000 It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause. Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  
  In for a penny, in for a pound. The Devil rides upon a fiddlestick A good tree brings forth good fruit. You win some, you lose some Give Neither Counsel Nor Salt till You Are Asked For ItAnd why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? Let the buyer beware A rolling stone gathers no moss. No man is an island 
  If you get it overnight, you can lose it just as quick  When two big bottle deh ah table lil one nah business deh. A nod is as good as a wink to a blind man. A fool and his money are soon parted.Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest  Fish and cast-net nah friend. Better to be envied than pitied Haste makes waste. Curiosity killed the cat. He who plays with fire will get burnt 
  A child is a person who can dismantle in 25 minutes the toy it took you 25 hours to put together.
