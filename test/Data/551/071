Time to say good bye.The deadline that we leave campus is in the 

corner. I read quite a lot of posts here these days ,filled with memories 

and sadness.Yes,it is the theme for our graduates.4 years in one's life,

not long enough maybe you will think,but it is the most important time

that in our life.We studied ,we got to know friends, we stepped in society,

we met the ones who fit ourselves in our lives...

    Happy memories and the same as the bad ones,we  take them all deep in 

our mind.When we come back to campus 10 years later,20 years later,or even

30 years later and so on,we will get back the sweet feelings we have ever

had.

    Last semester I began to write this series ,during the time ,I paused,

and resumed ,paused,and resumed. As always what kind of people I am ,but I

am still happy that I made it .Maybe it is not complete enough to describe

my graduating year,but it does speak out what I feel and what I think about

me ,about friends,about campus ,and about the society.

    All of you will make your way ,just remember you spent your magnificent

time in this university,you are always the one graduated from SCUT.
