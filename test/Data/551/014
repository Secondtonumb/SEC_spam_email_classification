These days graduates are busy with job hunting.

Friends of mine all devote ourselves into the study 

so as to be post-graduate. We are also tirdred as well

as the ones who are job hunters.

   When I began to write this series ,I made a plan 

that I post up an article every week,but as I am geting 

busier and busier, I have  no  enough time to finishi 

it perhaps.

   There are 60 days or so left to our deadline ,but the 

golden time for job hunting is the following 30 days or so.

Every graduate, cheer up and make your way to what you wanna

get .  

  For both the job hunters and post graduate candidates.  ^&^
