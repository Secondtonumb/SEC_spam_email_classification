  Better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all  One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters. Virtues all agree, but vices fight one another  You can lead a horse to water but.. how?. In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed Good fences make good neighbours!Every Ass Loves to Hear Himself Bray Easy come, easy go A Small Spark Makes a Great Fire. It is possible to give without loving but it is impossible to love without giving  
  Fools seldom differ. Lil ah sick, big a get better. Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches. Eat well, stay fit, die anywayA person who can smile when things go wrong has found someone to blame it on.  Look good, feel good Grease is the only cure for a hangover Youth nah ah weary but he ah fall down. Abstinence makes the heart go wander. He who knows better has never tried it Do not look where you fell, but where you slipped  
  Ill-gotten gains never prosper We had nothing to do and we did it very well  Every Soldier has the Baton of a Field Marshal in his Knapsack When poverty comes in at the door, love flies out of the window  An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth An old Ox makes a straight furrow He who plays with fire will get burnt Every rope gat two ends. Watch your thoughts, they become words Watch your words, they become actions, watch your actions, they become habits, watch your habits, they become characer Watch your character, it becomes your destiny  At the end of the game, the King and the pawn go back in the same boxIf you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher  Motivation is what gets you started habit is what keeps you going  
  Better an open enemy, than a false friend Fortune favours the brave Fools build houses, and wise men live in them True blue will never stain One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters. True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls  When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way.Many are called but few are chosen Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  The pen is mightier than the.. pigs. Lend your money and lose your friend 
  Use soft words and hard arguments If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. .
