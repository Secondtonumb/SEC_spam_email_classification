Revenge is sweet 

  One volunteer is worth ten pressed men If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. . The Gods Send Nuts to those who have no Teeth Gluttony kills more than the sword  Old habits die hard Judge not that you be not judgedBad news travels fast 
  All the world loves a lover Never the twain shall meet  Love many, trust few, but always paddle your own canoe Do right and fear no man  If you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher  Nah tek yuh mattie eye fuh see. Never eat an oyster unless there is an R in the monthTherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. When yuh buy ah dutty calico yuh gat fuh wear am till it tear. You cant buy love  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. An apple a day keeps the doctor away  
  Windows will never cease. Speak when you are spoken to I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.Many hands make light work Wise children have short years Aaah, a man who runs through airport swing-doors is going to Bangkok. When yuh deh in bad luck wet paper self ah cut yuh. The darkest hour is just before dawn A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
  When I turned myself over to God, i took my life out the hands of an idiotPerfection is inperfect You have to understand, somethings you will never understand  Knowing is not enough; We must Apply Willing is not enough; We must Do God helps those who help themselves If you educate a man you educate an individual but if you educate a woman you educate a family  A Man of Words and Not of Deeds is Like a Garden Full of Weeds. Old habits die hard If oil ah float watah deh ah battam.	 As you shall make your bed, so shall you..........mess it up. One of these days is none of these daysEvery flow hath its ebb 
  All good things must come to an end. No wind, no waves It is good to be knowledgeable, but better to be lovable  Never choose bedlinen or a wife by candlelight  Fish ah play ah sea, he nah know watah ah boil fuh am. Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. . A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.Do not look where you fell, but where you slipped  When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. A day of sorrow is longer than a month of joy. Fish ah deh ah watah but nah ah dam tap. 
  The nearer to the church, the farther from God Better to be safe than.. punch a 5th grader. God help the poor, for the rich can help themselves  The proof of the pudding is in the eating Silence is the fence around wisdomToo many cooks spoil the broth Life is not all beer and skittles When water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. The early worm enjoys a leisurely breakfast  Look after number one 
  Never eat an oyster unless there is an R in the month Murder will out Still waters run deepThe price of greatness is responsibility Fax is stranger than fiction. Softly, softly, catchee monkey  Where there's smoke, there's.. pollution. A sprat to catch a mackerel. Once in a while, right in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives us a fairy tale Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive 
  Life is just a bowl of cherries. Procrastination is the thief of time
