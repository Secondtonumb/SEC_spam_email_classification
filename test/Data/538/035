      Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly They that walk much in the sun will be tanned at last
      Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer! Strangers are just friends you have not met yet Every cloud has a silver lining
    
    
      Gentle is that gentle does Danger can never be overcome without taking risks 
      You are a long time dead Blethers say nought If practice makes perfect and nobody's perfect then why practice?. 
    
  
  Sleep is better than medicineContrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. Although the Wed Oct Shine, Leave Not Thy Cloak at Home The more the merrier  The best doctors are Dr Diet, Dr Quiet and Dr Merryman Keep your chin up A sly rabbit will have three openings to its den. Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground
