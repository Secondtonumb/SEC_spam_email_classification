      It is nice to be important but it is more important to be nice To thine own self be true For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

      Absence makes the heart go wander. When yuh deh in bad luck wet paper self ah cut yuh.Love nature , live lightly
      When man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am. After all is said and done, more is said than done  You are a long time dead If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the mountain 
    
  
  God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.as delicate as a baby's eye lashes Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. A black plum is as sweet as a white. Better die with honor than live with shame For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD. I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger  Bush get ears and dutty get tongue. Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise
