      Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. Chaste makes waste.
      Danger can never be overcome without taking risks  A picture paints a thousand words. To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
    
    
      It is better to travel hopefully than to arriveAnother day, another dollar It is a silly fish that is caught twice with the same bait 
      Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly No wind, no waves Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. If you wish to be loved, love You win some, you lose some 
    
  
  A book holds a house of gold.Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you A friend in need is a friend indeed. A stitch in time saves nine . Home is where you hang your @. You are a long time dead A proverb never lies, it is only its meaning which deceives. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. Do not look where you fell, but where you slipped  Only knife ah know whah in pumpkin belly.
