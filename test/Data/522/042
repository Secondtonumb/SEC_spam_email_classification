      A place for everything and everything in its place. All things are possible with god
      One foolish sheep will lead the flock The early bird catches the worm.
    
    
      Doubt is the beginning not the end of wisdom He who drinks Australian Thinks AustralianThe King can make a knight, but not a gentleman  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
      All roads lead to Rome No man is an island Never say die God made the country and man made the town! 
    
  
  Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.A whistling women and a crowing hen are neither fit for God or men. Revenge is a dish best served cold Cow deh a pasture he nah remember seh dog and butcher deh till he see am. Wasteful man money ah guh like butter in de sun. A cold bitter Christmas, a fat churchyard. Fools and madmen speak the truth A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
