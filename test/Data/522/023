*HOW TO ENGAGE YOUR PEOPLE - HARNESS THE POWER OF SERIOUS GAMES*

The term 'serious games' is the use of computer games specifically developed 
for non-entertainment purposes. This can range from training fire-fighters, 
to supermarket shelve-stackers, to improving performance amongst sales managers.

To learn more about how your organisation can benefit, come to 
The International Serious Games Event, being held in Birmingham, UK on June 5-6. 
The biggest event of its kind in Europe, it will be your chance to meet leading 
developers, hear from companies that have already benefited from Serious Games 
and view demonstrations of some of the latest Serious Games on the market.

In addition, we have now set-up pre-conference forums and a match-making service, 
allowing those who register to discuss the issues, help shape the conference content, 
as well as make connections with developers and potential commissioners prior to the event. 

If you know of a client, prospect or colleague that you would like to invite to our event, 
please direct them to http://syl.ex113y9jhky6.org.i5 or simply forward this email onto them.

Register by the 10th of April and save ?100 off the full price of ?295.
