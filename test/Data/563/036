Current news for the company

Falcon Energy, Inc. (fcyi - News) is pleased to announce that it has fully acquired the exploration licenses for five mining properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Management felt that the Opportunity presented by these properties was significant enough to forgo a planned participation by a second resource company. These licenses will be held for a minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Wedgolia has a wide variety of mineral resources. As of 1998, about 88% of the country had been geologically mapped but only 20% of the country's landmass had been licensed for exploration and 1www02yr4mz8.e80rh1 Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals. Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses are held include: Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as Fluorite and Uranium. 

So GET IN NOW - WILL EXPLODE in next 25 weeks!!

A rose is a rose is a rose. Read the tea leaves. Thick as a brick.   Play a harp before a cow. Your in hot water. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  To gild refined gold, to paint the lily. You feel like a fish out of water. Sweating blood.   You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.  This is for the birds.   Stir up an ant's nest.   Tossed around like a hot potato.   Two peas in a pod.  Stone cold sober.   Watch and wait.  A rose is a rose is a rose. Read the tea leaves. Put to bed with a shovel. We'll hand you out to dry. Where man is not nature is barren. Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Thick as a brick.  

Watch and wait.  Schools out for summer.   When the cows come home.  Plant kindness and gather love.   What's good for the goose is good for the gander. A rose is a rose is a rose. Watch and wait.  Sour as a green apple.   That's a whole new can of worms.   Run to seed.  Treat him like dirt. Where man is not nature is barren. Shit end of the stick.
