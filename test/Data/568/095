I used to think that I could not go wrong
And life was nothing but that an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I am leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there is nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes inside us, it can seem so long
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
Could I believe in it?
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there is nothing to it
I believe I can fly......
