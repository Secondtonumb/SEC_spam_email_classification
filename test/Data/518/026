Dear  Wedend,
 
I am Dr. Sergey Vilkov . and I represent Mr. Mikhail  
Khordokovsky the former C.E.O of Yukos Oil Company in  Russia. I have a 
very sensitive and confidential brief  from this top (oligarch) to ask 
for your partnership in  re-profiling funds US$42.3 Million. I will 
give the  details, but in summary, the funds are coming via Federal 
Ministry Of Finance Russia. This is a legitimate transaction. You will 
be  paid 10% for your "Management Fees".
 
If you are interested, 
provide me with your confidential telephone number,fax  number and 
email address and I will provide further  details and instructions. 
Please keep this confidential;  we can't afford more political 
problems. Finally, please note that this must be concluded within two 
weeks.
 
Please advice me on your position by email immediately,  as i 
look forward to your mail

Regards,
8w.f1r47x Vilkov
