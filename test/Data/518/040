12th International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems
- THERMINIC 2006 -
http://8zdo.h9p6.75/conferences/therminic/
27-29 September 2006
Nice, Cote d'Azur, France

Sponsored by:
- TIMA Labs Grenoble, France (CNRS - INPG - UJF)
- CPMT - Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology Society -

Deadlines:
Submission:   25 April 2006
Notification: 25 June 2006
**************************************

THERMINIC Workshops are a series of events to discuss the essential
thermal questions of microelectronic microstructures and electronic
parts in general.
These questions are becoming more and more crucial with the increasing
element density of circuits packaged together and with the move to
nanotechnology. These trends are calling for thermal simulation,
monitoring and cooling. Thermal management is expected to become an
increasingly dominating factor of a system¡¯s cost. The growing power
dissipated in a package, the mobile parts of microsystems raise new
thermal problems to be solved in the near future necessitating the
regular discussion of the experts in these fields. Finally, there is an
increasing need for accurate assessment of the boundary conditions used
in the analysis of electronic parts, which requires a concurrent
solution of the thermal behaviour of the whole system.
This year THERMINIC will address in addition to the ¡°traditional¡±
thermal management problems, also stress and
thermal-stress-related-reliability
issues, both in micro- and opto-electronics fields. These issues,
including various nanotechnology applications, are of significant
importance and of high interest to the engineering community engaged in
the field of thermal phenomens in ¡°high-tech¡± systems.
The Workshop is sponsored by the IEEE Components, Packaging, and
Manufacturing Technology Society and TIMA Laboratory.

Technical Programme
The programme will include oral talks, posters presentations, a panel
discussion and invited talks given by prominent speakers.

Invited talks will include:
- Michael Pecht, CALCE Electronic Products and Systems Center, U. of
Maryland, College Park, USA.
- Ari Glezer, Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia
Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA.

Tutorial
A Tutorial will be offered on 25 September, prior to the Workshop.
- Thermal Management in Practice: Sense, Nonsense, and Things that Go
Wrong.
Clemens Lasance, Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, The Netherlands
Robert Moffat, Stanford Univ., USA
For many designers, real-life is more like hell than paradise. There is
always a big discrepancy between the simplified textbook examples and
the complexity encountered in practice. This is especially true in the
thermal management of electronic parts and systems. This short course
will address several topics, widely used, that cause trouble when trying
to solve thermal problems in industry.
?  About the widespread misuse of correlations
?  CFD: todays' designer's delight, but...
?  Experimental errors: easy to make, easy to prevent
?  How to use an estimate of the uncertainty to improve the experiment

Detailed information about the submission process will be made available
on the THERMINIC Web page: http://8zdo.h9p6.75/conferences/therminic/

Venue
The Workshop will take place in the Boscolo Plaza Hotel which is located
in Nice.
Nice, located in the south of France, is the gem of the French Riviera:
elegant, chic, popular and antique. A University town and the business
hub of Provence, Nice sparkles with life all year round. Every form of
entertainment is available in this pleasant city of France, while a rich
cultural heritage fascinates visitors.
We are just 100 mt from Nice's famous Place Mass¨¦na and the Promenade
des Anglais, from exclusive downtown shopping, nightlife, and our
private beach, The Ruhl Plage.
The Boscolo Plaza Hotel is just a stone's throw from the historic Old
Town of Nice with its bustling narrow streets dating back to medieval
times, its many tempting food shops and restaurants and a growing number
of artists' workshops and galleries.
