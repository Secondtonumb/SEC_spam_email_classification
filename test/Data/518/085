      Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Love nature , live lightly Christmas comes but once a year, but Hallmark makes sure it lasts three months In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is King
      It takes two to make a quarrel Every cross has its inscriptions
    
    
      To many people in a dustbin means there not much room in side Curiosity killed the cat.A fool gives; a wise man takes.
      Beauty is in the eye of the beholder One volunteer is worth ten pressed men Speak softly and carry a cellular phone. When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way. Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy  God made the country and man made the town! 
    
  
  A stitch in time saves nine .All is for the best in the best of the possible worlds Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage  Blessings Are Not Valued Until They Are Gone There are none so blind as those that will not see Cheats never prosper Admiration is the daughter of ignorance  Mother knows best
