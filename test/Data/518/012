      Ask no questions and hear no lies Different strokes for different folk  Where there's smoke, there's.. pollution.
    
    
      Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.If you lie down with dogs you will come up with fleas  Poor men seek meat for their stomach; rich men stomach for their meat
