  The Fairest Rose at Last is Withered Abundance, like want, ruins many. Love many, trust few, but always paddle your own canoe A problem is a chance for you to do your best. Do right and fear no man  Like flogging a dead horse Fools rush in where angels fear to tread Stir With a Knife, Stir Up StrifeHe is always right who suspects that he makes mistakes Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both Nothing is interesting if you are not interested  
  Grow your own dope - plant a man! A camel is a horse designed by a committee.  What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts The early bird catches the worm.Rain, Rain, go away, come back another day The devil find work for idle hands to do Every flow hath its ebb The geek shall inherit the earth. Fortune favours the brave Orange yellow but yuh nah know if he sweet. 
  When yuh buy ah dutty calico yuh gat fuh wear am till it tear. Adversity Makes Strange Bedfellows Talk is cheap The Fairest Rose at Last is Withered Confession is good for the soul Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their meat. Flies Come to Feasts Unasked Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain and most fools do The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheeseHow long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
  Boys will be boys Let the buyer beware Like the measles, love is most dangerous when it comes late in life Wherever you may be let your wind go free For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD. Dream of a funeral and you hear of a marriage  God helps those who help themselvesUse soft words and hard arguments Happiness is wanting what you have - not having what you want They Brag Most That Can Do the Least Life is one long catwalk 
  Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly If you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher  Divide and rule
