Information for Presenters - VTC2006-Spring

Oral Presentation

Time Allocations

All presentations will be allocated 25 minutes for the paper, comprising 25 minutes for the talk and 25 minutes for questions and changeover.

Meeting with Session Chairs

All presenters are asked to meet with their session chair, in the scheduled room in which they will be presenting, 25 minutes prior to the start of the session. Presenters are asked to have a short biography of 2-3 sentences maximum to give to the session chair at this time.

Presentation Slides

We ask all presenters to bring their presentation slides to the meeting with session chairs, 25 minutes before the start of their session. They will then be loaded onto the PC in the presentation room prior to the start of the session.

Presentations should be brought to VTC2006-S to be uploaded onto the appropriate PC using a CD ROM or USB key.

We would strongly prefer for individual laptops not to be used for presentations at VTC2006-S.

Equipment

Standard equipment that will be available in each of the presentation rooms is as follows:
Projector Screen
Data Projector
PC with screen resolution 1024x768
Microsoft PowerPoint 2003,

If you require any other equipment, please contact James Scott <08cab.2bj46@4841.edu.d1> with your request. This should be done by 25 Oct 2006.

Poster Presentations

Poster boards will be 150 cm high and 100 cm wide. Posters must be dimensions smaller than the board. Posters should be put up during the half hour preceding the session and removed at the end of it. Please be available to speak about your poster throughout your session.
