These Claims are more particularly located at the northern end of the
El Indio Belt in Chile Region III which is approximately 150 kms. East

   1.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Vendor will grant to the
       Company the sole and exclusive irrevocable right and title to
the
       Claims, subject to:


       (i)   the completion by the Company of confirmation of legal
title
             and due diligence on the Properties as to ownership by
the
             Vendor and results therefrom being satisfactory to the
Company,
             acting reasonably, within a period of  90 days;

       (ii)  the right to extend a further 90 days by mutual consent.
(the
             right to extend a further 90 days has been granted to the
             Company, in an effort to complete its due diligence);

      (iii)  The Vendor and the Company shall put forth, all their
             reasonable best efforts to obtain a satisfactory title
opinion
             or Court Order, or such that the Company will acquire the
             property freee and clear of all liens and encumbrances,
with a
             view to further develop the property into an operating
mine.

   2.  Upon satisfactory completion of the due diligence and clear
title
       being established, the Company will then:

       (a)   issue to the Vendor Twenty Million (20,000,000) Common
Shares,
             upon the execution by the parties of this Agreement and
subject
             to the subject conditions as set out above; and

       (b)   that all original documents or notarized copies of
official
             translations are therefore required to complete the
             transactions contemplated in the Agreement. The issuance
of the
             25 Million (20,000,000) Common Shares shall be issued in
the
             Vendors designated name to the benefit of Vendor, upon
the
             removal of the subject conditions as set out above.

   3.  Further, satisfactory completion of the due diligence and clear
title
       being established the Purchaser with the assistance of the
Vendor,
       (if necessary), will apply for permits to the appropriate
authorities
       to place the property into production. Upon the appropriate
permits
       being approved, the Purchaser will have the option to acquire
an
       additional 25% interest in the property (bringing the Purchaser
       interest to 75%) in exchange for a further issuance of Ten
Million
       (10,000,000) Common shares of the Company's stock.

   We are presently pursuing further due diligence on these Claims.

   On Behalf of the Board
   INFINEX VENTURES INC.
