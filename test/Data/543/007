Dear:Sir/Madam,


I am Hon. 8w.g6l02 Irabo, Director allocation department from the (First

Bank of Nigeria Plc,)Lagos 7a5y69.og office monitors and controls the

affairs of all banks and financial institutions in Nigeria concerned with

foreign claim payments.


I am the final signatory to any transfer or remittance of huge funds

moving within banks both on the local and international levels in line

with foreign claim settlement.


I have before me list of funds, which could not be transferred to some

nominated accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost

accounts, unclaimed deposits and over-invoiced sum etc.


Your Name was among the people expecting the funds to be transferred into

their account, on this note; I wish to have a deal with you as regards to

your unpaid funds.I have your file before me and hope your data's are

correct and un-tampered unless you reconfirm it not correct.


As it is my duty to recommend the transfer of these surplus funds to the

Federal Government Treasury and Reserve Accounts as unclaimed deposits, I

have the opportunity to write you based on the instructions I received two

days ago from the Foreign Debts reconciliation dept to submit the List of

payment reports/ expenditures and audited reports of revenues.


Among several others, I have decided to remit your claim sum following my

idea that we can have a deal/agreement and I am going to do this legally.

My conditions:


1. The sum of USD$9.7M only will be transfer into your account after the

proccessing of all relevant legal documents with your name as the bonfide

beneficary,the transfer will be made by Draft or telegraphic Transfer

(T/T), confirmable in 25 working days.


2. This deal must be kept secret forever, and all correspondence will be

strictly by email / telephone, for security purposes.


3. There should be no third parties as most problem associated with your

fund release are caused by your agents or representative.


If you AGREE with my conditions, l advise you on what to do immediately

and the transfer will commence without delay as I will proceed to fix your

name on the Payment schedule instantly to meet the seven days mandate.


I hope you don't reject this offer and have your funds transferred.


Waiting for your reply soon.
