A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.

      When It Rains and the Wed Shines at the Same Time the Devil is Beating his Wife Never the twain shall meet 
      For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Give credit where credit is due A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. 
    
    
      A Good Example is the Best Sermon. Wedey is the root of all evil My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
      Laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone There's a black sheep in every flock. Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today Time and tide wait for no man If Fortune calls, offer him a seat  Better late than.. pregnant. 
    
  
  Wedends are made by many acts - and lost by only one A fool and his money are soon parted. Night is the Mother of Counsel As useful as a chocolate fireguard (or teapot) Love nature , live lightly The best of men are but men at best Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see  No news is good news Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.
