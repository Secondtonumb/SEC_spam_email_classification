There is an account opened in this bank in 1997 and since my inception 
into office in 2001, nobody has operated on this account again. I have 
the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be 
capable for this important transaction. 

In order to transfer out 
?30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Pounds Sterling) After going through

approval and onward transfer of this fund into your account with 
appropriate clearance from foreign payment q5w7ylts14.41y will stand to 
get 25% while 5% will be for the expense that will be encure during the 
process, And 70% will be for me.
