Not a sound from the pavement°£
Has the moon lost her memory£ø
She is smiling alone°£
In the lamplight£¨
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan°£
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days°£
Life was beautiful then°£
I remember the time I knew what happiness was°≠°≠
Let the memory live again
