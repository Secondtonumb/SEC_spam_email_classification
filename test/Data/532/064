      <td><font size="2">A proverb is a true word. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Pentium wise; pen and paper foolish. Strike while the.. bug is close. Honesty is the best policy The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble  Keep your mouth shut and your ears open. </font></td>

  <font size="2">Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow  Good people are scarce<BR><BR>It takes two to make a quarrel Love conquers all And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed. For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. Everything comes to him who waits If trousers say massah teef, yuh can't doubt am.
