WE SEE A RUN STARTING TO HAPPEN.
You may not be aware of  A B S Y , but you should be, because this company
represents a terrific profit opportunity for early investors.
Sick of hedge funds and flippers getting all the great new issues?
Most stock brokers give out their new issues only to their largest
commission paying clients.
A $1,000 dollar investment could yield a $2,000 dollar profit in
just ONE trade if you trade out at the top.
Big watch in play this tomorrow morning!
Our mission is to claw our way through the thousands of underperforming
companies out there to find the golden needle in the haystack.
