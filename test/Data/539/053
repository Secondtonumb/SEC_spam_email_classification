Good day to you,
I trust you will be interest to have this deal sealed up with me, as it is risk free without any form of financial commitment from you whatsoever.

I am the Director-General of the above named Ministry and in collaboration with the Minister of Finance, we jointly wish to move the sum of $25million out of the country but needed a foreigner who will recieve the funds on our behalf as we do not have a foreign accounts of our own for security reasons.
This transaction will cost $80,000, which includes:
tipping of some Government Officials that will sign for the release and transfer of these funds to your account, 
Bank handling Charges and Taxes but you are not expected to contribute a DIME towards the financial aspect of this deal.
NOTE: If i request any kind of payment from you, all you will do is to discontinue. This is a promise to prove to you that I will not ask you to pay any money to make this deal happen.


I will find an INVESTOR who will provide the above amount in the form of SOFT LOAN to you, which will be paid back to him after the funds has been dully received by you through your confident account and confirmed. This investor will not know that the money belongs to us but belongs to you and on that basis he will have the $80,000.00 sent to you to finance the deal and once the funds are made available to you, you will then re-send the money back throught the attorney that will re present you to sign all documents on your behalf so that the bills be paid and for the $25m to be wired to your account without further delay.
