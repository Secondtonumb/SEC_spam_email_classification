MONEY TRANSACTION 



My name is g4.jqv and I work in the 
International 
operation department in a Local Bank here in South 
Africa. On a routine 
inspection I discovered a 
dormant domiciliary 
account with a BAL. Of 
36,000,000,00 (Thirty Six Million USD) on 
further discreet
investigation,

I also discovered that the account 
holder has long 
since  passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to 
the account. The 
bank  will approve
this money to any foreigner 
because the former 
operator of  the a/c is a foreigner and from Iraq 
in particular and I 
am certainly  sure that
is dead, and nobody will 
come again for 
theclaim of this  money A foreigner can only claim this 
money with 
legal claims to 
the account Holder; therefore I need your 
cooperation 
in this transaction.I will provide the necessary 
information needed in 
order 
to claim this money,But you will need to 
open an account where 
this can be transferred. If  interested send 
your private Telephone No.
And Fax number including full 
details of 
the account to be used for 
the Deposit I wish for utmost 
confidentiality in handling this 
transaction as my job and  the future 
of my family would be jeopardized 
if it were breached. I want to 
assure you that the transaction is 
without risk  if due process is 
followed accordingly. Finally, I wil 
give you 25% for your 
corporation.
I looking forward to a favorable 
response.
YOUR REGARD
MR,
ESA
