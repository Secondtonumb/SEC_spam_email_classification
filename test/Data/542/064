Once bitten twice shy  The early bird catches the worm 

  Angry Men Make Themselves a Bed of Nettles He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount Fine feathers make fine birds Strike while the.. bug is close. He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount If trousers say massah teef, yuh can't doubt am. A soft answer turneth away wrath. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegarFortune favours the brave The best of men are but men at best 
  Pick your friends like you pick your fruit On the Turf all men are equal, and under it  Cat a ketch rat, but he a teef he massa fish. He who hesitates is lost Familiarity breeds contempt Doubt is the beginning not the end of wisdomFortune favours the brave Love is blind. Bread is the staff of life Penny wise, pound foolish Better die with honor than live with shame 
  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  A good mate is the road map for the spaghetti junction of life. When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern Curses, like chickens, come home to roost You cannot get blood from a stone The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom Revenge is sweet A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains. Look before you leap 
  Great oaks from little acorns grow The best advice is found on the pillowWhen Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman He who comes with a story to you will bring two away from you Diamonds cut diamonds Visit your aunt, but not every day of the year Revenge is a dish best served cold A new broom sweeps clean, but the old brush knows all the corners.  Silence is the fence around wisdomWater that has been begged for does not quench the thirst Ill-gotten gains never prosper 
  Rats desert a sinking ship Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief  Experience is the best teacher A bad workman blames his tools. You are a long time dead A child is a person who can dismantle in 25 minutes the toy it took you 25 hours to put together. Pentium wise; pen and paper foolish. Beware of Greeks bearing gifts  Past cure, past careAnd say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. Too many clicks spoil the browse  A journey of a thousand sites begins with a single click. 
  Excess of ceremony shows want of breeding  We do not care of what we have, but we cry when it is lost Genius is an Infinite Capacity for Taking Pains Only fools and horses work Fogiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the foot that crushed it If you lie down with dogs you will come up with fleas  Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy  Elementary sartorial techniques initially applied obviate the need for repetitive similar actions to the square of three. 
  Books and friends should be few and good Oh, what a tangled Web site we weave when first we practice. When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.You cannot get blood from a stone An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked. And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the mountain He who plays with fire will get burnt Be kind to people on the way up, you may need them when you are on your way down A helping hand is no farther than at the end of your sleeve.  Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing Slow fire ah boil hard cow-heel. 
  People living in glass houses should not pelt stones.
