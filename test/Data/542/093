ADDRESS: PLOT 204 PALZA DE VILLI

IKEJE,LAGOS NIGERIA.

TELEPHONE:234-802-528-7123

  

Dear Sir,


You may naturally be surprised to get this proposal since we have not met before or discussed about business.


But permit me to humbly advice you not to discard or reject the content and good intent of this proposal despite the fact that we have not met each other .This information I am conveying to you today, if accorded appropriate attention and confidentiality it deserves, will without any atom of doubt transform your life. Do not let fear and doubt debar you from the offer I am presenting to you today. He who exercises caution in an evidently danger-free situation is not wise.


My name is Barrister James Williams, an attorney-at-law. I am writing to you concerning the pathetic fate of my late client, g4.91hf0ki3 Couch, an American citizen, from Iowa State. He was awarded a 5-year Turn Around Maintenance{T.A.M.}and allied contract services on revolving basis by the Nigerian Refineries Management Agency{N.R.M.A.}and he put a luster performance record during the course of this project. He executed this contract meritoriously to the satisfaction of the entire management of NRMA.


But as fate may have it, g4.91hf0ki3 Couch, wife and only child, unfortunately died in a ghastly plane crash on the 11th of December, 2005 while returning from a party in Abuja the country capital. You can refer to the Hallmark National Newspaper, 12\12\2005, page 3, for verification of incident or view the scene of the crash and new update:

At the time of his death, he had the sum of eighteen million seven hundred and fifty three thousand United State's Dollars {$18,753,000} only outstanding debt to collect from NRMA, through his bank. By dint of hard work coupled with my compassion for my late client, through legal battles I was able to persuade the N.R.M.A. to pay the above amount of money in favour of my client late Mr. Couch.


After three consecutive weeks of legal battle with the bank, the cheque was finally paid to the bank, but late Mr. Couch has no legitimate next-of-kin or beneficiary to claim the money till date. As an attorney, it behooves me to assist my late client's family to get the deceased's money but obviously not at the expense of breaching the law.


Following this development therefore, I started earnestly searching for the late contractor's family through the American Embassy in Nigeria and other sources in U.S.A. but all to no 64t2v.271,a greater problem than getting Mr. Couch's next-of-kin has arisen. The bank has given me 25 days ultimatum to provide Mr. Couch?s family member or the account be declared unserviceable. Hence, I write you to act as the next-of-kin to late Mr. Couch . You will get 30% as compensation and my Chamber 60%. While 10% will be for all local and international expenses during this transaction.


This transaction is 100% risk free. I think I have sincerely explained the whole truth to you. Thanking you in advance for your co-operation and camaraderie. Hope to receive your call or email soon. 


Best regards. 

Barrister James Williams.
