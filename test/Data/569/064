      Youth and Old Age Will Never Agree A hedge between keeps friendship green.
      A man's reach should exceed his grasp. The Devil rides upon a fiddlestick
    
    
      There's no fool like an old fool.Trust is the mother of deceit If the wind will not serve, take to the oars
      Caught between a rock and a hard place. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. The stick is the surest peacemaker 
    
  
  Never the twain shall meet When It Rains and the Wed Shines at the Same Time the Devil is Beating his Wife Fair exchange is no robbery  You win some, you lose some Prevention is better than cure Beautiful is not what is beautiful, but what one likes  When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. Softly, softly, catchee monkey  Discretion is the better part of valour Draw Not Your Bow Till the Arrow is Fixed
