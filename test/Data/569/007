Langdon looked again at the fax an ancient myth confirmed in black and white. 
The implications were frightening. He gazed absently through the bay window. 
The first hint of dawn was sifting through the birch trees in his backyard, 
but the view looked somehow different this morning. As an odd combination of fear and 
exhilaration settled over him, Langdon knew he had no choice 
The man led Langdon the length of the hangar. They rounded the corner onto the runway.

upside down
In slow motion
afraid of what
he was about
to witness, Langdon
rotated the fax
180 degrees. He
looked at the word
 light a long time
Stunned, Langdon 
collapsed in a chair
He sat a moment in
utter bewilderment
Gradually, his eyes
were drawn to the
blinking red light
on his fax machine
Whoever had sent this
fax was still on the
line waiting
to talk. Langdon
gazed at the blinking
He felt like a paleontologist
Langdon?s eyes
were locked on
the brand. Illuminati
he read over and over
His work had always
been based on the
symbolic equivalent
of fossils
documents and historical 

hearsay but this image 
before him was
today. Present tense
