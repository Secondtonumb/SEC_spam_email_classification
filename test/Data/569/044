      Have you ever noticed? anybody going slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac Great starts make great finishes. A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. Never judge someone until you have travelled a mile in their shoes
      Perfection is inperfect When gaulding see fish he forget seh gun deh. Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred 
    
    
      There are two sides to every questionPardon all but theyself
      Practice makes perfect and Nobody's perfect. He who hesitates is lost. The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. A friend in need is a friend indeed. 
    
  
  He that plants a tree plants for posterityOn the Turf all men are equal, and under it  People living in glass houses should not pelt stones. If yuh eye nah see, yuh mouth nah must talk. A drop of ink may make a million think. Time is a great healer The Mills of God Grind Slowly, Yet They Grind Exceedingly Small In vino veritas  Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you
