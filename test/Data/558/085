      The young man thinks the old mans stupid but the old man KNOWS the young man is No pain, no gain 
    
    
      Zeal without knowledge is the sister of folly Jack of all trades, master of noneA crowd is not company.  After a storm comes a calm.
      Teaching of others teacheth the teacher Draw Not Your Bow Till the Arrow is Fixed No one grows old by living; only by losing interest in living Is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness A stitch in time saves nine. 
    
  
  Well Begun is Half Done If me bin know always deh behind de door.Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down A man is known by the company he keeps.

Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep An English Summer, Three Hot Days and a Wednderstorm
