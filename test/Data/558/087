VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 05, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) - As part of the commitment of Falcon Energy, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, to keep
investors informed of its status and activities, the company is providing this
investor update.

Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount
Westlock property in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since
the well was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed
over 10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range.
The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue for the company and its shareholders.

Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed
addition of its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will be forthcoming.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct 17, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) -- Falcon Energy, Inc.
is pleased to announce that the granting of exploration licenses for five mining properties in Wedgolia has been finalized. These licenses will be held for a
minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy, Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Falcon Energy, Inc. had recently sought the mineral rights to these
significant properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals.

The five licensed areas are:

8825E - The Duhum Hujirt License Area
8454X - Tsagaan Tolgoi Copper/Gold Project
9997X - The Huld License Area
9996X - The Har Tolgoi License Area
9668X - Hutagt License Area

Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses
are held include:
Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as
Fluorite and Uranium.

Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. Home is where you hang your hat Like the measles, love is most dangerous when it comes late in life Lean liberty is better than fat slavery Those who play the game do not see it as clearly as those who watch A fool will laugh when he is drowning. Exigency is the matriarch of ingenious contrivance. Easy come, easy go When I turned myself over to God, i took my life out the hands of an idiot

Baby who ah cry ah house and ah door ah same thing. A gentleman without an estate is a pudding without suet.  
Lucky at cards, unlucky in love Every bush a man night time. One beats the bush, another takes the bird Everyone stretches his legs according to the length of his coverlet So long as you do your best in life, whatever happens will be for the best And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! People living in glass houses should not pelt stones. Many a mickle makes a muckle Never eat an oyster unless there is an R in the month Never judge a book by its cover. Zeal without knowledge, is fire without light Wedendship is like money,easier made than kept Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud A stitch in time saves nine. Nowt so queer as folk!


Once bitten twice shy  Don't put all your hypes in one home page. If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. Better to be safe than sorry The early bird catches the worm Count your blessings Give a clown a finger and he will take your hand  Never eat an oyster unless there is an R in the month Fogiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the foot that crushed it 


Dont teach your grandmother to suck eggs Great minds think alike Love many, trust few, but always paddle your own canoe One cannot quarrel without an opponent  Like music to my ears No man is wise at all times  Quality is better than quantity
