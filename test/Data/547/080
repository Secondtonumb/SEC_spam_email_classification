it's bang and parenthetic not passport be ease and balboaLive Hoodia Testimonial


When asked in the recent 60 Minutes interview how Hoodia
worked for her CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl said she 
had no after effects ? no funny taste in her mouth, 
no queasy stomach, and no racing heart. 

She also wasn't hungry all day, even when she'd normally 
have a pang around mealtime. She also had no desire to 
eat the entire day. 

"I'd have to say it did work," says Stahl.
