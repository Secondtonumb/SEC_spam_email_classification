Dear Prof. Hua and Mr. Yang,

 

As the coordinator of the report, I hereby address my sincere compliment to you and those who made great efforts and contribution to the report. The report is prepared and completed in a high quality, with which we feel quite satisfied. Please also kindly note that the final report should be binded up as stipulated in the contract. By the way, we are under processing the payment request and will complete in a short period of time.

 

Prior to this time, our company is substantially occupied with commissioning activities and cannot give the report appropriate attention. Due to that we are considering to simplify the project. We, after our prudent consideration, would not convene the evaluation meeting for the report. 

 

We believe it is a good beginning of the cooperation between two friendly partnerships, also it is proved that the research centre leading by Prof. Hua is worthy, reliable and cooperative partner. 

Should there is any further query, please feel free to let me know.

 

Best regards,

Angel Ling ¡Ëª∂
