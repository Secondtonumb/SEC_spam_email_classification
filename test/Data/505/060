      The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world A bad penny always turns up.

      A man comes from the dust and in the dust he will end - and in the meantime it is good to drink a sip of vodka. Fish and guests smell in three days Age is a very high price to pay for maturity What we see depends mainly on what we look for  Life is one long catwalk

Mind your own business Daddies know best
