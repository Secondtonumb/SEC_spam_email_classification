They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. The
room was soon full of intermittent cries of Impedimenta! People froze
for a minute or so, during which their partner would stare aimlessly
around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and
take their turn at the jinx.
Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when Harry
had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and Hermione
again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others. When
he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temptation to walk past
her several more times.
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all
over the floor and started practising Stunning again. Space was really
too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the
group observed the others for a while, then swapped over.Hi,
