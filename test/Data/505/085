Dear Wedend,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet 
your personal Ethics. I introduce myself as Liam a staff in the 
accounts management Section of a well-known bank here in the United 
Kingdom.

One of our accounts with holding balance of ??15,000,000 
(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and last operated in 
the past 25 years.

From my investigations and confirmations, the owner 
of this account is a Foreigner by name Gerald Stone died on the 4th of 
January 2002 on a plane crash in Birmingham here in UK. 

Since then 
nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money as he 
has no family Member who is aware of the existence of either the 
account nor the Funds. 

Information from the National Immigration also 
states that he was single on entry into the UK.

I have confidentially 
discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and we have 
agreed 
to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus 
propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of 
these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due 
processes have been followed.


This transaction is totally free of 
risk and troubles as the fund is Legitimate and does not originate from 
drug, money laundry,terrorism or any other Illegal act.

On your 
interest, let me hear from you.

Regards,

Liam.
