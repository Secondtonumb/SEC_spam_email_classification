""Annie ? "You killed him. The cop looked like a big doll that has been badly treated by a gang of nasty children. 


Christ, Annie, the rats! Shes always quoting her mother, but your own mother had a few sayings, too, didnt she? Then, on July 19th, both the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News announced Annies arrest.
You tape a very fine thread across each one, and if you come back and find one broken, why you know, dont you? Geoffrey was right, of course ? dear old Geoffrey was rarely wrong ? but sometimes when he was alone, the Gearless of Miserys escape from the Grim Reaper came forcibly home to him, and it was nearly impossible to hold the tears back. just forget I said anything.   And that other voice returned at once: I dont know if youll be damned by God or saved by him, Paulie, but one thing I do know: if you dont find a way to bring Misery back to life a way she can believe ? shes going to kill you. But babies, defective or not, werent the same as old folks dying of renal failure or car-crash victims brought in still somehow alive in spite of heads which were only half there or steering-wheel-sized holes in their guts.
