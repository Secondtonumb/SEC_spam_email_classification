Well, said Hermione, look on the bright side - at least now youll have
time to do Snapes essay!
Thats a bright side, is it? snapped Harry, while Ron stared
incredulously at Hermione. No Quidditch practice, and extra Potions?
Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly
from his bag and set to work. It was very hard to concentrate; even
though he knew Sirius was not due in the fire until much later, he could
not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. There
was also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George
appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which
they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd.Hi,
