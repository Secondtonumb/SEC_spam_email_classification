      A cat may look at a king. A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. One foolish sheep will lead the flock Better to be alone than in bad company 
      He who laughs last laughs longest People who think the world revolves around them have no sense of direction A stitch in time saves nine .
    
    
      It is easier to get forgiveness than permission Fate leads the willing but drives the stubborn But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
      Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. Speak when you are spoken to All good things come to he who waits  A danger foreseen is half avoided. Boys will be boys If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried before. 
    
  
  Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. Things can only get betterAll good things come to those who wait. You cant buy love  Love conquers all Smile and the world smiles with you, snore and you sleep alone Time and tide wait for no man Love many, trust few, but always paddle your own canoe Judge not that you be not judged
