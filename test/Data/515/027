  The most beautiful women are made for lovers who lack imagination Beauty is in the eye of the beholder What we see depends mainly on what we look for  Life is not all beer and skittles C:\ is the root of all directories. When two big bottle deh ah table lil one nah business deh. When yuh play out all yuh trump cards yuh gat to lose till game done. Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. Never put off til tomorrow what you can do todayThe best of men are but men at best Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg To err is human, to forgive divine A hedge between keeps friendship green. 
  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. He That Will Not Be Counselled Cannot Be Helped Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt meThere is a skeleton in every cupboard  It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned 
  There is illumination at the termination of the subterranean excavation. A picture paints a thousand words. Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred  All are not cooks that walk with long knives Melt the icy fingers of fear with the sunshine of hope  You do well to believe in God Wedan also believes and tremblesThe road to hell is paved with good intentions Baby who ah cry ah house and ah door ah same thing. 
  The pot calls the kettle black. The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit  Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. In April,a youg mans thoughts turn to fancy! A hedge between keeps friendship green. He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.Penny wise, pound foolish No one grows old by living; only by losing interest in living Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit. A fair exchange is no robbery. 
  Live and learn  If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. Time and tide wait for no man.
