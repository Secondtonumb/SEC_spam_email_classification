Dear International Student Recruiter,

The pressure\'s on. Your task is to recruit international students of good quality in good numbers from many parts of the world. Your budget is limited, so is your time. Your staff are few, those you have are stretched, and some have limited experience. No need for stress! There is a solution to your problem - thanks to QS and QISAN\'s unique partnership for education agents\' events and resources.

Did you know that up to 60% of international students are recruited through education agents? Yet this sector is not always well understood by institutions. Education agencies are ideally situated to recruit for overseas institutions in the country where they operate because:

- they have the local language and culture of the students and parents,
- they understand the local education system and market,
- they have acquired knowledge of the study opportunities of their clients and of the important practical issues such as finance, immigration, accommodation and travel.

A network of well motivated and informed agents can become a vital partnership for your institution and an effective substitute for extensive recruitment visits, especially to countries on your medium priority list.

Education agents are usually SME\'s (small to medium-size enterprises). They work for profit and, while the great majority operate professionally, those few who don\'t can give a bad impression of the sector as a whole. Institutions are naturally wary of appointing unsatisfactory agents and, because of this, frequently shy away from agents altogether. Also, as it is common for agents to work on a percentage of fees, those institutions who charge low fees to students may feel that they cannot use them. Yet, with the right approach and understanding, there are many ways to take advantage of this fast growing and improving profession. Indeed, those who don\'t  may well get left behind in the increasingly competitive market for international students.

The QS Education Agents\' Workshops offer a superb opportunity for institutions to meet and appoint quality international student recruitment partners in the form of vetted education agents and to learn, through briefings and seminars, best practice in appointing and managing education agents for optimum results. In the latter half of 2006, they will take place in:

- Singapore (9 - 25 July),
- London (30/31 October)
- Beijing (10/11 November)

Visit syl.6jp45r5hdo6.com for full details including prices, accommodation and registration forms.

The QS Education Agents\' Workshops are operated in partnership with QISAN (Quality International Study Abroad Network - see syl.hn33q.com), the worldwide accreditation body for education agents and consultants. QISAN has already accredited over 1,300 agents from over 72 countries and is carrying out a thorough programme of accreditation destined to increase the number to 2,000 by mid 2007. It provides professional benchmarking and codes of practice and ethics for education agents.

QS Education Agents\' Workshops, consistent with QS general philosophy of working with and for high achievers, are aimed at attracting quality education agents who wish to represent quality academic institutions. All the agents accepted for the Workshops will be either fully accredited QISAN agents or will have been fully referenced prior to the event.

Make the most of these exceptional opportunities to delegate your international student recruitment in a reliable, exciting and professional fashion!
