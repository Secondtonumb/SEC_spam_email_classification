      Love many, trust few, but always paddle your own canoe Cat a ketch rat, but he a teef he massa fish.
      The pen is mightier than the.. pigs. Strangers are just friends you have not met yet Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse
    
     
      God made the country and man made the town! Do as you would be done byWhen water throw away ah ground yuh can't pick am up. You can't teach a new mouse old clicks.
      Do not praise yourself while going into battle; praise yourself coming out of battle Opportunity seldom knocks twice Old sins cast long shadows  Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl Ill-gotten gains never prosper 
    
  
  You cannot burn the candle at both endsGood gubby nah ah float ah tap. One good turn deserves another. A good man is hard to find. A man in love is a fool, and an old man in love is the greatest fool of all. If you lie down with the dogs, you'll.. stink in the morning. The Ass Loaded With Gold Still Eats Thistles Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground  All things are possible with god A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
