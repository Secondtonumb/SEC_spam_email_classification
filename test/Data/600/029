Business before pleasure

      A man that breaks his word bids other be false to him. A scalded cat fears cold water. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
      A best friend is like a four leaf clover, Hard to find and lucky to have. Hunger is the best sauce Mind your own business Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense
    
    
      Better an open enemy, than a false friend A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.He who hesitates is lost.
      Least said soonest mended Better late than.. pregnant. Too many clicks spoil the browse. 
    
  
  You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar Old fish and young flesh feed men bestA little of what you fancy does you good.  We had nothing to do and we did it very well  God is Always on the Side of the Big Battalions Lightning never strikes twice in the same place A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. You can lead a horse to water but.. how?. Seven years nah too much fuh wash speck off ah bird neck.
