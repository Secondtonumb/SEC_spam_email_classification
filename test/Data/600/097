Good Day my dear, 
I am Madame Aisha Mohamed from Ivory Coast. I am a widow being that I lost my usband a couple of months ago. My husband was a serving director of the Cocoa exporting board until his death . He was assassinated last january by the rebels following the political 
uprising. 

Before his death he had a foreign account here in Cota d'Ivoire up to the tune of $14.5M which he told the bank was for the importation of cocoa processing machine. I want you to do me a favour to receive this funds to a safe account in your country or any safer place 
as the beneficiary. I have plans to do investment in your country, like real estate and industrial production and I am going to take it as my personaltask to assist the  widows like me. This is my reason for writing to you. 

Please if you are willing to assist me and my only son Abdoul, indicate your interest in replying soonest. My email is: y44wf7b7n0@yahoo.75
Thanks and best regards .
