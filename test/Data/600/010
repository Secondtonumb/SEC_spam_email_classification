      Give and spend and God will send Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. There is no accounting for taste 
      When you live in the past, it costs you the present  Zeal without knowledge is the sister of folly Necessity is the mother of invention.
    
    
      For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.Without rice, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook  An English Summer, Three Hot Days and a Wednderstorm
      You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong He who awaits much receives little Rats desert a sinking ship. When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern  
    
  
  A friend is not so soon gotten as lost.Practice what you preach  Nah tek yuh mattie eye fuh see.

Under the thorn grow the roses
