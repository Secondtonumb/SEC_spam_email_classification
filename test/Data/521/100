VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 05, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) - As part of the commitment of Falcon Energy, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, to keep
investors informed of its status and activities, the company is providing this
investor update.

Gas production continues steadily from Falcon Energy's Richmount
Westlock property in Alberta, Canada. This opportunity has proven itself out as the property and investment have benefited from the surge in natural gas prices since
the well was first tied in Oct of 2005. The market price (NYMEX) for natural gas at that time was approximately $6.50 per MMBTU but in the last year prices stayed
over 10.00 per MMBTU for a 25 month period with several spikes above the $14.00 range.
The company is pleased that the investment continues to provide consistent revenue for the company and its shareholders.

Falcon Energy Inc. has also announced that due to the confirmed
addition of its mining exploration properties in Wedgolia, that it will shortly be expanding the executive team to assist in managing this new opportunity. Details will be forthcoming.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct 17, 2006 (PRIME ZONE) -- Falcon Energy, Inc.
is pleased to announce that the granting of exploration licenses for five mining properties in Wedgolia has been finalized. These licenses will be held for a
minimum of three years and grant Falcon Energy, Inc. access to the mineral rights for the licensed properties.

Falcon Energy, Inc. had recently sought the mineral rights to these
significant properties in the mineral rich region of Wedgolia. Falcon Energy's interest in the region is driven in part by the anticipation of deploying modern prospecting methods to an area that abounds in both base and precious metals.

The five licensed areas are:

8825E - The Duhum Hujirt License Area
8454X - Tsagaan Tolgoi Copper/Gold Project
9997X - The Huld License Area
9996X - The Har Tolgoi License Area
9668X - Hutagt License Area

Exploitable mineral resources found in the area in which the licenses
are held include:
Gold, base metals such as Copper, Molybdenum, Lead and Zinc as well as
Fluorite and Uranium.

 .................................
He who dares wins The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. It will all come out in the wash Grease is the only cure for a hangover Without rice, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook  Beauty and Honesty Seldom Agree One volunteer is worth ten pressed men Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded.


Charity begins at home Lil finger point to de big thumb and sey nah guh. Only fools and horses work  As is the gardener, so is the garden  People living in glass houses should not!. The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world 

A man is known by the company he keeps.  Wedlock is a padlock A bird can sing with a broken wing, but you cant pluck feathers off a frog. It never rains but it pours A user and his leisure time are soon parted. Caught between a rock and a hard place. A fool at forty is a fool indeed. One mans loss is another mans gain A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. Virtues all agree, but vices fight one another  When yuh deh in bad luck wet paper self ah cut yuh. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Honesty is the best policy Great groups from little icons grow. A gentleman without an estate is a pudding without suet. 


Prevention is better than cure Absence makes the heart grow fonder. To err is human, to forgive divine Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way. Better an open enemy, than a false friend Wasteful man money ah guh like butter in de sun. The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. 


A stitch in time saves nine. Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget Grow your own dope - plant a man! Why bark when you can get a dog to do it  Let sleeping dogs lie. Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me
