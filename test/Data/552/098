      as dry as chapped lips Love is the strangest thing To thine own self be true A stumble may prevent a fall.
      If oil ah float watah deh ah battam.	 You get what you give Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea .
    
    
      Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel.Look before you leap.
      For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil. An ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept  A wonder lasts but nine days. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence 
    
  
  Live to the point of tearsRats desert a sinking ship Wise men think alike. If you believe everything you read, you better not read For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. Judge not that you be not judged Don't cross your bridges before you come to them.
